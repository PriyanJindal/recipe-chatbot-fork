Query: I'm vegan and gluten-free and also hate vegetables. What can I eat?
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for you that is both vegan and gluten-free, and it highlights flavors without relying heavily on vegetables. Let’s make **Spiced Chickpea and Sweet Potato Patties**!

### Ingredients:
- 1 can (15 oz) of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 medium sweet potato (about 1 cup, cooked and mashed)
- 1 cup gluten-free oats 
- 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil for frying

### Serving Size:
This recipe makes approximately 4 patties, enough for 2 servings.

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Sweet Potato**: Start by cooking the sweet potato. You can either boil it until tender (about 15 minutes) or poke holes in it and microwave it for about 5-7 minutes until soft. Once cooked, peel and mash the sweet potato in a bowl.

2. **Activate the Flaxseed**: In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 2 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it forms a gel-like consistency. This will act as a binding agent for your patties.

3. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, add the rinsed chickpeas and use a fork or potato masher to gently mash them. You don’t want a completely smooth mixture; leaving some chickpeas whole adds texture to your patties. 

4. **Mix in Remaining Ingredients**: Add the mashed sweet potato, activated flaxseed mixture, gluten-free oats, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper to the chickpeas. Mix everything until well combined.

5. **Form Patties**: Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties, roughly 1/2 inch thick. If the mixture feels too wet, add a bit more gluten-free oats until it holds together.

6. **Cook the Patties**: In a non-stick skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the patties to the skillet (cooking in batches if necessary to avoid crowding). Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.

7. **Serve**: Once cooked, remove the patties from the skillet and let them drain on a paper towel. Serve warm, and you can enjoy them with a side of tahini sauce, avocado, or your favorite vegan dipping sauce.

**Enjoy your Spiced Chickpea and Sweet Potato Patties! They’re packed with protein and flavor, and you might find that they’re a tasty way to enjoy wholesome ingredients without a strong veggie presence.**

Query: Raw vegan soup that's actually warm somehow?
Dietary Restriction: raw vegan
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here’s a delightful recipe for a Raw Vegan Warm Soup that utilizes the warmth of spices and a few clever techniques to create a comforting bowl without any cooking involved.

### Raw Vegan Spiced Tomato and Basil Soup

#### Serving Size:
2 people

#### Ingredients:
- 4 large ripe tomatoes
- 1 medium red bell pepper
- 1 small cucumber
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon sea salt (adjust to taste)
- A handful of fresh basil leaves
- 1 cup of filtered water (adjust for desired consistency)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables**: Start by washing the tomatoes, bell pepper, and cucumber under cold water. Cut the tomatoes into quarters and remove the seeds if you wish for a smoother texture. Chop the red bell pepper into large pieces and the cucumber into chunks.

2. **Blend the Base**: In a high-speed blender, combine the chopped tomatoes, red bell pepper, and cucumber. This combination forms the vibrant base of your soup. 

3. **Add Aromatics and Spice**: Next, add the garlic clove (peeled), olive oil, fresh ginger, smoked paprika, dried oregano, and sea salt to the blender. 

4. **Blend Until Smooth**: Blend on high until the mixture is completely smooth. This should take about 1-2 minutes. The friction from the blades will gently warm the soup, making it feel cozy and comforting without cooking.

5. **Incorporate Fresh Basil**: Once blended, add the fresh basil leaves to the mixture and pulse the blender just a few times until the basil is roughly chopped but not completely puréed. This will provide beautiful flecks of green in your soup.

6. **Adjust Consistency**: If you prefer a thinner soup, slowly add in the filtered water while blending until you reach your desired consistency. 

7. **Taste and Adjust Seasoning**: Grab a spoon and taste your soup! You can adjust the seasoning by adding more salt or spices according to your preference.

8. **Serve Warm**: Pour the soup into bowls and allow it to sit for a minute, as the blending process will have warmed it slightly. If you’d like it a tad warmer, you can briefly blend it again for a few seconds while holding the lid tightly.

9. **Garnish and Enjoy**: Optionally, you can garnish the soup with a few whole basil leaves or a drizzle of olive oil before serving. Enjoy your warm raw vegan tomato and basil soup!

Enjoy your deliciously unique soup experience!

Query: Vegetarian curry but I don't eat onions or garlic for religious reasons
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here’s a delightful recipe for a **Vegetarian Coconut Curry**, without onions or garlic, that serves 2 people.

### Vegetarian Coconut Curry

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup of mixed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers, peas, cauliflower)
- 1 cup of coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil (or coconut oil)
- 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger, grated
- 1 tablespoon of curry powder
- 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon of cumin powder
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)
- Cooked rice or naan, for serving

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables**: If you haven't done so, chop your mixed vegetables into bite-sized pieces. This allows for even cooking and better texture in the curry.

2. **Heat the Oil**: In a medium-sized pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. You can use coconut oil for a richer flavor, especially since it pairs well with the coconut milk.

3. **Sauté the Ginger**: Once the oil is hot, add the grated ginger to the pot. Sauté it for about 1 minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning. This step will release its aromatic flavor.

4. **Add Spices**: Sprinkle in the curry powder, turmeric powder, and cumin powder. Stir the spices with the ginger for about 30 seconds, letting their fragrance fill the air. This step is crucial to activate the essential oils in the spices.

5. **Incorporate the Vegetables**: Add the mixed vegetables to the pot and stir well, coating them with the spice mixture. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the vegetables to soften slightly.

6. **Add Coconut Milk**: Pour in the coconut milk and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Once it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the flavors meld together.

7. **Season**: Taste the curry and add salt and pepper as needed.

8. **Serve**: Once the curry is ready, you can serve it hot, garnished with fresh cilantro if desired. Enjoy it with your choice of cooked rice or warm naan to soak up all that delicious sauce.

   On a large baking sheet, toss the broccoli, baby carrots, and red bell pepper strips with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, mixing everything well to coat the vegetables in oil.

4. **Place Chicken on the Baking Sheet:**
   Remove the chicken from the marinade and place it in the center of the baking sheet, surrounded by the vegetables.

5. **Bake:**
   Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C) and the vegetables are tender.

6. **Serve:**
   Once done, remove from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. If desired, sprinkle freshly chopped parsley over the chicken and vegetables for extra flavor and a pop of color. Serve hot and enjoy!

### Tips:

- 1/4 cup grated cheese (Parmesan or dairy-free alternative), optional

   - While the pasta is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Sauté for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant—make sure not to let it burn.

3. **Cook the Shrimp:**
   - Add the shrimp to the skillet. Season with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they turn pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set them aside on a plate.

4. **Deglaze the Pan:**
   - In the same skillet, pour in the white wine (or vegetable broth) and let it simmer for about 2 minutes to reduce slightly, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. This will enhance the flavor.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Lower the heat to medium and add the lemon juice and zest to the skillet. Stir to combine. Return the shrimp to the skillet, along with the cooked pasta and reserved pasta water. Toss everything together to coat the pasta and shrimp in the sauce. If the mixture seems dry, you can add a bit more pasta water.

6. **Finishing Touches:**
   - Stir in the chopped parsley and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Allow everything to heat through for another minute.

7. **Serve:**
   - Divide the shrimp scampi pasta onto two plates, and if desired, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top before serving. Garnish with extra parsley for a fresh touch.

- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup sugar-free sweetener (e.g., erythritol or stevia, to taste)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare Your Molds**: Start by preparing a silicone candy mold or a mini muffin tin. If you’re using a muffin tin, line it with cupcake liners for easier removal.

2. **Make the Chocolate Mixture**: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the melted coconut oil, unsweetened cocoa powder, sugar-free sweetener, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Stir well until the mixture is smooth and fully combined. This will be your chocolate coating.

3. **Add the First Layer**: Pour a small amount (about a tablespoon) of the chocolate mixture into each mold or muffin cup, just enough to cover the bottom. Place the mold in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes until the chocolate sets.

Once the chocolate is firm, take the mold out from the freezer and spoon the peanut butter mixture on top of the chocolate layer, filling each mold about halfway or to your preferred taste.

5. **Top with More Chocolate**: Cover the peanut butter layer with the remaining chocolate mixture, ensuring it completely seals the peanut butter. Tap the mold gently to remove any air bubbles and smooth the tops.

6. **Freeze**: Place the mold back into the freezer for about 30 minutes or until completely set. 

7. **Serve**: Once firm, carefully remove the peanut butter cups from the mold. They can be enjoyed immediately or stored in an airtight container in the fridge for later.

Query: Gluten-light recipe - I'm not celiac just sensitive
Dietary Restriction: gluten-free
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here's a delicious and gluten-light recipe for **Quinoa and Spinach Stuffed Bell Peppers**. This dish is vibrant, nutritious, and perfect for two servings.

### Quinoa and Spinach Stuffed Bell Peppers

#### Ingredients:
- 2 medium-sized bell peppers (any color)
- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)
- 2 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup shredded cheese (optional, choose your favorite; for a lighter option, you can use feta)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Prepare the Quinoa:**
   In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth (or water) to a boil. Add the rinsed quinoa, a pinch of salt, and stir. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   While the quinoa is cooking, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion becomes translucent (about 3-5 minutes). Stir in the chopped spinach and continue to cook until the spinach wilts, which will take about 2 minutes.

4. **Combine the Filling:**
   In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, sautéed onion, garlic, and spinach. Add the dried oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper to taste. If you're using cheese, mix half of it into the filling and reserve the rest for topping.

5. **Prepare the Bell Peppers:**
   While you’re mixing the filling, cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds. You can keep the tops for decoration if you like, or chop them for another use.

6. **Stuff the Peppers:**
   Spoon the quinoa mixture into each bell pepper, packing it lightly but not too tightly. Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish.

7. **Bake:**
   If using, sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of each stuffed pepper. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to retain moisture and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

8. **Serve:**
   Carefully remove the stuffed peppers from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm, garnished with fresh herbs if desired. 

#### Serving Size:
This recipe serves 2 people, with each person getting one stuffed pepper.

Enjoy your healthy and gluten-light meal!

### Honey Garlic Chicken Recipe

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/3 cup honey
- 1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium if preferred)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (or rice vinegar)
- Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)
- Fresh parsley or green onions for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   Start by patting the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. This helps in achieving a nice sear. Season both sides with salt and pepper to taste.

2. **Heat the Oil:**
   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken breasts to the skillet. 

3. **Sear the Chicken:**
   Sear the chicken for about 5-6 minutes on one side without moving it, allowing a golden crust to form. Flip the chicken and sear the other side for another 5-6 minutes, until cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). Once done, remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.

4. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Be careful not to burn it. Lower the heat to medium, then add in the honey, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes if using. Stir the mixture well and bring it to a gentle simmer.

5. **Glaze the Chicken:**
   Return the seared chicken breasts to the skillet, turning them to coat with the sauce. Let it simmer in the sauce for about 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.

6. **Serve:**
   Once the chicken is well coated and the sauce is sticky, remove it from heat. You can slice the chicken or serve it whole. Drizzle any remaining sauce from the skillet over the top. For an optional garnish, sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley or green onions.

7. **Enjoy!**
   Serve the honey garlic chicken alongside your choice of side dish, such as rice or quinoa, to absorb the delicious sauce. This will make for a hearty and delightful meal!

This recipe is simple, quick, and full of flavor, making it a great healthy option without relying on vegetables. Enjoy your cooking!
