Query: Whole30 compliant dinner that my non-Whole30 husband will actually eat
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious Whole30-compliant recipe that even your non-Whole30 husband will likely enjoy. Let’s make **Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Roasted Vegetables**. This dish is fresh, flavorful, and beautifully balanced.

### Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Roasted Vegetables

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients

**For the Grilled Chicken:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the Roasted Vegetables:**
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 cup bell peppers, sliced (any color)
- 1 small zucchini, sliced
- 1 carrot, sliced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions

1. **Marinate the Chicken**: In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is coated well. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours if you have time for more flavor).

2. **Preheat the Oven**: While the chicken is marinating, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) for the roasted vegetables.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables**: In a large bowl, combine the broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini, and carrot. Drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss everything together until the vegetables are evenly coated.

4. **Roast the Vegetables**: Spread the vegetable mixture on a baking sheet in a single layer. Place in the preheated oven and roast for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly crispy on the edges. Toss halfway through cooking to ensure even roasting.

5. **Grill the Chicken**: While the vegetables are roasting, preheat your grill (or grill pan) over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Grill the chicken for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked (the internal temperature should reach 165°F or 75°C). Let the chicken rest for a few minutes after cooking.

6. **Serve**: Slice the grilled chicken breasts and serve alongside the roasted vegetables on plates. Drizzle any remaining lemon juice over the chicken and vegetables for extra flavor.

### Enjoy!
Not only is this dish Whole30 compliant, but it's also satisfying and bursting with flavor! The grilled chicken is juicy and aromatic, while the roasted vegetables provide a lovely texture and sweetness. Perfect for both Whole30 followers and non-followers alike!

Query: Low-carb pizza recipe - I miss pizza so much
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious low-carb pizza recipe that will satisfy your cravings while keeping things healthy. This recipe uses cauliflower to make the crust, making it a great alternative to traditional pizza dough.

### Low-Carb Cauliflower Pizza

#### Servings: 2

**Ingredients:**
- 1 medium head of cauliflower (about 3 cups riced)
- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 cup pizza sauce (sugar-free for a low-carb option)
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (for topping)
- Optional toppings: pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, spinach, basil, etc.

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven:** Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.

2. **Prepare the cauliflower:** Remove the leaves and core from the cauliflower, then cut it into smaller florets. Place the florets in a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice or fine crumbs. You should have about 3 cups of riced cauliflower.

3. **Cook the cauliflower:** Transfer the riced cauliflower to a microwave-safe bowl and cover it. Microwave on high for about 4-5 minutes until soft. Once cooked, allow it to cool for a couple of minutes.

4. **Remove excess moisture:** Place the cooked cauliflower into a clean kitchen towel or cheese cloth. Twist and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial to getting a crispy crust!

5. **Mix the crust ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine the riced cauliflower, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, the egg, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until fully combined.

6. **Shape the crust:** Transfer the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Use your hands or a spatula to spread it out into a round shape (about 1/4 inch thick), making sure to create a slight edge for the crust.

7. **Bake the crust:** Place the crust in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until it’s golden brown and firm. Keep an eye on it to avoid burning.

8. **Add toppings:** Once the crust is done, take it out of the oven and spread the pizza sauce evenly over the top. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and add any additional toppings you desire.

9. **Final bake:** Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

10. **Serve:** Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Slice into wedges and serve warm. Enjoy your delicious low-carb pizza!

Query: Diabetic-friendly dessert that doesn't use artificial sweeteners
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful diabetic-friendly dessert recipe for **Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies**. This recipe uses wholesome ingredients and avoids artificial sweeteners while still being delicious!

### Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies

**Servings:** 2 (approximately 4 cookies)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (melted) or unsalted butter
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (preferably 70% cacao or higher)
- Optional: 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon for added flavor

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cookies from sticking.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, baking soda, sea salt, and cinnamon (if using). Whisk together until they are well blended. The almond flour adds a nutty flavor, and the baking soda will help the cookies rise slightly.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, mix together the melted coconut oil (or butter), egg, and vanilla extract. Stir thoroughly until the mixture is smooth. The oil should be warm but not too hot, as you don't want to cook the egg.

4. **Combine Mixtures:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined, making sure not to overmix. The dough will be moist and slightly sticky.

5. **Fold in Chocolate Chips:** Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips. These will add sweetness and rich flavor to your cookies. 

6. **Scoop the Dough:** Using a tablespoon or a cookie scoop, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Leave enough space between each cookie, as they may spread a little while baking. Aim for about 2 to 3 inches apart.

7. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.

8. **Cool:** Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. **Serve and Enjoy:** Once cooled, enjoy these cookies as a tasty, diabetic-friendly dessert! They pair beautifully with a cup of herbal tea or a glass of almond milk.

These cookies store well in an airtight container at room temperature and can last for a week. Enjoy your delicious and healthy dessert!

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables:** Start by washing and prepping your vegetables. Halve the cherry tomatoes, dice the cucumber and bell pepper, and finely chop the red onion. If using fresh herbs, chop the parsley and basil.

2. **Combine the Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the halved cherry tomatoes, diced cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, drained chickpeas, sliced olives, chopped parsley, and basil. If you choose to add an avocado for creaminess, now is the time to carefully dice it and add it in.

3. **Make the Dressing:** In a small bowl or jar, squeeze the juice of one fresh lemon. Add the olive oil, then season with salt and pepper to taste. Whisk or shake the jar until the mixture is well combined.

4. **Dress the Salad:** Pour the dressing over the salad mixture in the bowl. Gently toss all the ingredients until everything is well-coated in the dressing. Be careful if you've included avocado, as you want to maintain those lovely chunks.

5. **Taste and Adjust:** Before serving, take a moment to taste the salad. If you’d like a little more zing, add an extra squeeze of lemon or a pinch more salt and pepper.

6. **Serve:** Divide the salad evenly between two plates or bowls. It makes a vibrant and filling meal that bursts with fresh flavors.

Query: I'm vegan and gluten-free and also hate vegetables. What can I eat?
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for you: **Savory Chickpea Pancakes**! They’re vegan, gluten-free, and can be made without many traditional vegetables. This recipe will yield 2 servings.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup chickpea flour
- 1 cup water
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin (optional, for flavor)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (for the pan)
- Optional toppings: avocado, salsa, or vegan yogurt 

### Instructions:

1. **Make the Batter:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of chickpea flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin (if using). Slowly add 1 cup of water while whisking until the batter is smooth. It should have a pouring consistency, similar to pancake batter. Let the mixture rest for about 10-15 minutes; this helps the flour to hydrate.

2. **Preheat the Pan:**
   - Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and let it warm up. You can check if it’s ready by sprinkling a drop of water in the pan; if it sizzles, it’s time to cook!

3. **Cook the Pancakes:**
   - Pour about 1/2 cup of the batter into the hot pan, tilting the pan gently to spread the batter evenly into a circle. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until the edges begin to dry and the bottom is golden brown.
   - Flip the pancake carefully using a spatula and cook for another 3-4 minutes on the other side until it turns golden brown as well. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the pan as needed.

4. **Serve:**
   - Once done, serve the pancakes warm. You can top them with slices of avocado, a dollop of salsa, or a spoonful of vegan yogurt according to your preference.

These savory chickpea pancakes are not only quick and easy but also packed with protein and fiber, making them satisfying without relying heavily on vegetables. Enjoy your meal!

Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: Absolutely! You can substitute honey with agave syrup, maple syrup, or date syrup for your vegan yogurt breakfast. Here’s a delicious recipe for a Vegan Yogurt Parfait that serves 2:

### Vegan Yogurt Parfait with Fruit and Granola

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups dairy-free yogurt (coconut, almond, or soy-based)
- 1 cup granola (check to make sure it's vegan)

#### Instructions:

1. **Layer the Yogurt**: Start by taking two clear glasses or bowls. Place a generous half-cup of dairy-free yogurt at the bottom of each glass. It’s important to use a clear vessel so you can see the beautiful layers!

2. **Add the Sweetener**: Drizzle 1 tablespoon of agave syrup or maple syrup over the yogurt in each glass. This step adds a lovely sweetness to your parfait, and you can adjust the amount to suit your taste.

3. **Incorporate Fruits**: Next, layer on your sliced banana and mixed berries. Divide the fruit evenly between the two glasses, creating colorful layers. You can alternate the fruits or mix them together for variety.

4. **Add Granola**: Sprinkle a quarter cup of granola over the fruit in each glass. The granola adds a delightful crunch, making your breakfast satisfying.

5. **Repeat the Layers**: Add another half-cup of the dairy-free yogurt on top of the granola in each glass, followed by another drizzle of the agave syrup or maple syrup. This gives each layer a bit of sweetness and enhances the flavor.

6. **Top It Off**: Finish your parfait with the remaining banana slices, berries, and an extra sprinkle of granola. If you’re using chia seeds, sprinkle them on top for added nutrition and texture. A dash of cinnamon can also enhance the flavor!

7. **Serve Immediately**: Your Vegan Yogurt Parfait is ready to enjoy! Serve it fresh for breakfast or as a snack.

Query: Vegan chocolate cake for my birthday but I'm also trying to avoid refined sugar
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for a Vegan Chocolate Cake that uses natural sweeteners, perfect for celebrating your birthday without refined sugar! This recipe serves 2 people.

### Vegan Chocolate Cake (Refined Sugar-Free)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup whole wheat flour (or any preferred flour)
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup ripe bananas (about 1 large banana, mashed)
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/4 cup maple syrup (or agave syrup)
- 1/4 cup almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a small cake pan (6-inch round or similar) with a bit of oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these together until they are well mixed and there are no lumps.

3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients**: In another bowl, combine the mashed banana, unsweetened applesauce, maple syrup, almond milk, vanilla extract, and vegetable oil. Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated and smooth.

4. **Combine Mixtures**: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently fold the mixtures together using a spatula, being careful not to over-mix; you want to combine everything just until there are no flour streaks visible.

5. **Bake the Cake**: Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan. Smooth the top with the spatula if necessary. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs (but no wet batter).

6. **Cool the Cake**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. After that, carefully transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

7. **Serve**: Once cooled, you can enjoy it as is or dust it with a little powdered cocoa or serve it alongside fresh fruit. If you want to elevate it even more, consider making a simple frosting with a banana and a bit of cocoa powder blended together; this will keep it refined sugar-free.

And there you have it—a delicious vegan chocolate cake that's perfect for your birthday while steering clear of refined sugars. Enjoy your special day!

Query: I want a cheeseburger but I'm dairy-free and vegetarian. I know this sounds impossible but I'm really craving the taste and texture of a classic American cheeseburger and I haven't had one in 3 years since I went vegetarian and developed lactose intolerance
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have the perfect recipe for you! Let's make a delicious **Dairy-Free Vegetarian Cheeseburger** that captures the classic taste and texture while adhering to your dietary preferences. This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup black beans, drained and rinsed (or 1 can)
- 1/2 cup cooked quinoa
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs (use gluten-free if desired)
- 1/4 cup diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp cumin
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 tbsp olive oil (for cooking)
- 2 slices dairy-free cheese (such as almond or coconut-based)
- 2 whole grain burger buns (check that they're dairy-free)
- Lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Pickles (optional)
- Vegan mayo (optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Burger Mixture:**
   - In a medium mixing bowl, mash the black beans with a fork until they are mostly smooth but still have some texture. This will provide the base for your burger.
   - Add the cooked quinoa, breadcrumbs, diced onion, minced garlic, smoked paprika, and cumin to the mashed beans. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Mix everything together until well combined. If the mixture feels too wet, add a bit more breadcrumbs; if it's too dry, add a splash of water or more cooked quinoa.

2. **Form the Patties:**
   - Divide the mixture into two equal parts and shape each part into a burger patty. Make sure they’re firm and well-formed to avoid breaking during cooking.

3. **Cook the Patties:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmery, carefully add the patties to the skillet.
   - Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and heated through. In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of dairy-free cheese on top of each patty. Cover the skillet with a lid to help melt the cheese.

4. **Toast the Buns:**
   - While the patties are cooking, you can toast the burger buns in a separate pan or a toaster until they are lightly golden. This adds a nice crunch and prevents them from getting soggy.

5. **Assemble the Burgers:**
   - On the bottom half of each toasted burger bun, place a lettuce leaf, followed by the cheesy black bean quinoa patty. Top it with a slice of tomato, pickles, and a dollop of vegan mayo if desired. Garnish with the top half of the bun.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve your dairy-free vegetarian cheeseburgers with a side of sweet potato fries or a fresh salad. Enjoy your satisfying and flavorful cheeseburger!

This recipe offers a hearty bite reminiscent of classic cheeseburgers, while being completely dairy-free and vegetarian. Enjoy your meal!

4. **Cook the Shrimp**: Increase the heat to medium-high and add the seasoned shrimp to the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until the shrimp turn pink and opaque. Remove shrimp from the skillet and set aside.

5. **Make the Sauce**: In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, lemon zest, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir to combine and let it cook for about 1 minute, allowing the flavors to meld.

6. **Combine Pasta and Shrimp**: Return the shrimp to the skillet with the sauce. Add the cooked pasta and toss everything together to coat the pasta thoroughly in the lemon garlic butter sauce. If the mixture seems dry, gradually add some reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.

7. **Serve and Garnish**: Remove from heat, taste, and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary. Plate the pasta and shrimp, then garnish generously with freshly chopped parsley. For an extra touch, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top if desired.

Query: Kosher dessert for Passover
Dietary Restriction: kosher
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for **Flourless Chocolate Cake**, perfect for Passover and delicious regardless of dietary restrictions. This rich and decadent dessert serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 4 oz (113g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped
- ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
- ¼ cup (50g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup (60ml) unsalted butter, melted (or use coconut oil for a dairy-free option)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt
- Optional: Powdered sugar for dusting
- Optional: Berries or whipped cream for serving

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Prepare a small 6-inch round cake pan by greasing it lightly with butter or oil, and line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Melt the Chocolate**: In a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler), combine the chopped chocolate and melted butter (or coconut oil). Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each until fully melted.

3. **Mix the Batter**: Once the chocolate mixture is melted and slightly cooled, add in the granulated sugar and stir until combined. The mixture will look thick at this point. Next, add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, incorporate the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.

4. **Sift the Dry Ingredients**: In a small bowl, sift the unsweetened cocoa powder into the chocolate mixture. Gently fold the cocoa into the batter using a spatula, taking care not to overmix. You want everything to be smoothly combined but without vigorous stirring.

5. **Bake the Cake**: Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes or until the edges are set and a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter). Avoid overbaking to keep the cake fudgy.

6. **Cooling**: Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then run a knife around the edges and invert it onto a plate. Carefully peel off the parchment paper.

7. **Serving**: You can dust the top with powdered sugar for a beautiful presentation and serve warm or at room temperature. Pair it with fresh berries or a dollop of whipped cream for added richness and contrast.

Enjoy your **Flourless Chocolate Cake** as a delightful conclusion to your Passover meal!

Query: I don't like vegetables but I want to eat healthy
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have a delightful recipe for you that is healthy yet doesn’t rely heavily on vegetables. Let’s make **Lemon Garlic Chicken Thighs**. This dish is flavorful, juicy, and doesn't require any veggies!

### Lemon Garlic Chicken Thighs

**Servings**: 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- Juice of 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- Fresh parsley or basil (optional, for garnish)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade**: In a mixing bowl, combine the minced garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper. Whisk until well blended.

2. **Marinate the Chicken**: Place the chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring that it's well coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours if you have the time for maximum flavor.

3. **Preheat the Oven**: About 15 minutes before you're ready to cook, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

4. **Sear the Chicken**: Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade (reserve the marinade) and place the thighs skin-side down in the hot skillet. Sear for about 5-7 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy.

5. **Transfer to Oven**: Flip the chicken thighs over so the skin side is up. Pour the reserved marinade into the skillet around the chicken. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).

6. **Rest**: Once cooked, remove the skillet from the oven and let the chicken rest for about 5 minutes. This helps retain the juices.

7. **Serve**: Plate the chicken thighs and pour some of the pan juices on top. If desired, sprinkle with fresh parsley or basil for a touch of color. Enjoy your Lemon Garlic Chicken Thighs with a side of couscous or rice for a complete meal!

This recipe is simple, healthy, and sure to please your palate without a focus on vegetables. Enjoy!

Query: I don't like vegetables but I want to eat healthy
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for **Lemon Garlic Grilled Chicken** that is healthy and packed with flavor, but does not include any vegetables. This dish can be served with a side of rice or potatoes, making it a complete meal. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade**: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. This mixture will act as both a marinade and a basting sauce for your chicken.

2. **Marinate the Chicken**: Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it is well coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour. If you can marinate it longer (up to 4 hours), the flavors will deepen.

3. **Preheat the Grill**: If you’re using an outdoor grill, heat it to medium-high. If you're using a grill pan on the stovetop, place it over medium heat and add a little drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking.

4. **Grill the Chicken**: Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess drip off. Place the chicken on the hot grill or grill pan. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side without moving it to develop nice grill marks.

5. **Flip the Chicken**: Once browned, flip the chicken breasts over. Using a brush, baste the top side with some of the reserved marinade. Cook for another 6-7 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). This will ensure that the chicken is cooked through and juicy.

6. **Rest the Chicken**: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest on a plate for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist bite.

7. **Serve**: Slice the chicken if desired and garnish with fresh parsley for presentation. Serve the grilled chicken alongside a simple portion of rice or mashed potatoes for a fulfilling meal.

Query: I'm pescatarian but shellfish makes me sick
Dietary Restriction: pescatarian
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for a Lemon Herb Baked Cod that’s both simple and flavorful, perfect for a pescatarian diet without any shellfish. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Lemon Herb Baked Cod

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cod fillets (about 6 ounces each)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Lemon slices (for garnish, optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Prepare the Baking Dish**: Lightly grease a baking dish with a small amount of olive oil or line it with parchment paper for easy cleanup.

3. **Make the Marinade**: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. This mixture will infuse the fish with bright flavor and keep it moist.

4. **Coat the Cod**: Place the cod fillets in the baking dish. Pour the marinade over the fillets, ensuring they are well coated. You can gently rub the marinade into the fish to ensure even coverage.

5. **Let it Rest**: Allow the coated fillets to sit for about 10-15 minutes at room temperature. This will enhance the flavor as the fish absorbs some of the marinade.

6. **Bake the Cod**: Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork and is opaque in the center. The timing may vary slightly depending on the thickness of your cod fillets.

7. **Serve**: Once done, carefully remove from the oven. Transfer the cod to plates, drizzle any remaining pan juices over the top, and garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices if desired.

Query: I'm mostly vegetarian but I eat fish sometimes
Dietary Restriction: pescatarian
Recipe Response: Great! I have the perfect recipe for you: **Lemon Herb Grilled Salmon with Quinoa Salad**. This dish is flavorful, healthy, and very satisfying. 

### Serving Size:
2 people

### Ingredients:
For the salmon:
- 2 salmon fillets (about 6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 lemon (zest and juice)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the quinoa salad:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups vegetable broth or water
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 1 bell pepper (any color), diced
- ¼ red onion, finely chopped
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Quinoa Salad
1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Place the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water for about 1 minute. This helps remove its natural bitterness.
   
2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth (or water). Bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for another 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.

3. **Mix the Salad**: In a large bowl, combine the fluffed quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, and parsley.

4. **Dress the Salad**: In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Pour this dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Set aside to let the flavors meld.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Salmon
1. **Marinate the Salmon**: In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them, ensuring they're well-coated. Let them marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

2. **Preheat the Grill**: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If you're using a grill pan on the stovetop, heat it over medium-high as well, lightly greased.

3. **Grill the Salmon**: Place the marinated salmon on the grill, skin-side down if applicable. Grill for about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets. The salmon should easily flake with a fork when it's cooked through, and you want to achieve a nice char on the outside.

#### Step 3: Serve
1. **Plate the Dish**: On each plate, place a generous portion of the quinoa salad. Top it with a grilled salmon fillet.

2. **Garnish (Optional)**: You can garnish with additional lemon slices or fresh herbs if desired.

Enjoy this refreshing and healthy meal that showcases the delicious flavors of grilled salmon alongside a vibrant quinoa salad!

Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for **Lemon Herb Quinoa Salad**. This dish is light, refreshing, and filling, making it perfect for a satisfying meal. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water or vegetable broth (for extra flavor)
- 1 medium cucumber, diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/4 red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (or more, to taste)
- 1/4 cup fresh mint or basil, chopped (optional)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Begin by rinsing the quinoa under cold water in a fine mesh sieve. This removes the natural coating called saponin that can give quinoa a bitter taste.

2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water (or vegetable broth for added flavor). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and has absorbed all the liquid. You’ll know it’s ready when you see the little spirals (the germ) separating from the seeds.

3. **Fluff and Cool**: After cooking, remove the saucepan from heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 minutes. Then, uncover and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Spread it out on a plate or a large shallow dish to cool slightly.

4. **Prepare the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooling, prepare your vegetables. Dice the cucumber, halve the cherry tomatoes, and finely chop the red onion. If using, chop the fresh herbs—parsley, mint, or basil.

5. **Make the Dressing**: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. This dressing will bring all the flavors together beautifully.

6. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa, diced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, parsley, and any additional herbs you’re using. Pour the lemon dressing over the mixture. Gently toss everything together until well-combined, ensuring the dressing evenly coats the ingredients.

7. **Taste and Adjust**: Before serving, taste the salad and adjust seasoning as needed, adding more salt, pepper, or lemon juice to your preference.

8. **Serve**: Divide the lemon herb quinoa salad between two plates or bowls. This dish can be enjoyed immediately, but it also tastes great after chilling in the fridge for a while, allowing the flavors to meld.

Query: I'm vegan but I really want to make something with honey - is there a good substitute? i am craving a yogurt breakfast
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: Absolutely, for a vegan yogurt breakfast, you can use agave syrup or maple syrup as a great substitute for honey. They provide a similar sweetness without any animal products. Here's a delicious recipe for Vegan Yogurt Parfait with Agave Syrup that you might enjoy!

### Vegan Yogurt Parfait with Agave Syrup

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups of dairy-free yogurt (coconut, almond, or soy)
- 1 tablespoon of agave syrup (or maple syrup)
- 1 cup of granola (ensure it's vegan)
- 1 cup of mixed berries (fresh or frozen, such as strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries)
- A sprinkle of cinnamon (optional)
- A few mint leaves for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Yogurt Mixture:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine the dairy-free yogurt and the agave syrup. Stir well until the agave is fully blended into the yogurt. Taste and adjust the sweetness if desired, adding more agave if you prefer a sweeter dish.

2. **Layer the Parfait:**
   - Take two serving glasses or bowls. Start by adding a generous layer of the yogurt mixture to the bottom of each glass, filling them about halfway.

3. **Add the Granola:**
   - Next, sprinkle a layer of granola over the yogurt in each glass, about 2-3 tablespoons depending on your preference. The granola adds a nice crunch and complements the creaminess of the yogurt.

4. **Add the Berries:**
   - Now it's time to layer in the mixed berries. Divide the berries between the two glasses, placing them on top of the granola layer. If you're using larger berries like strawberries, you can slice them for a nicer presentation.

5. **Repeat the Layers:**
   - On top of the berries, add another layer of the yogurt mixture to fill the glasses almost to the top. Repeat with another layer of granola and then finish with the remaining berries.

6. **Finish and Serve:**
   - If you want to add a flavorful touch, you can sprinkle some cinnamon on top of the final layer of berries. Finish it off with mint leaves for a refreshing touch if you have them.

7. **Enjoy:**
   - Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious Vegan Yogurt Parfait as a nourishing breakfast!

This parfait is highly customizable, so feel free to mix in different fruits or toppings based on what you have on hand. Enjoy your breakfast!

Query: I eat pretty clean most of the time
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Great to hear! I have a delicious and healthy recipe for you: **Lemon Garlic Herb Grilled Chicken**. This dish is light, flavorful, and perfect for a clean-eating approach. 

### Lemon Garlic Herb Grilled Chicken

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:** In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Whisk together until well combined. Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish, and pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it is well-coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and let it marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, but ideally 1-2 hours for best flavor.

2. **Preheat the Grill:** Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. If using a grill, make sure the grates are clean and lightly oiled to prevent sticking.

3. **Grill the Chicken:** Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off, then place the chicken on the preheated grill. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side without moving it. This allows nice grill marks to form. Flip the chicken and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes on the other side until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C).

4. **Rest the Chicken:** Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest on a cutting board for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring moist and tender chicken.

5. **Serve:** Slice the grilled chicken and transfer it to a plate. Optionally, garnish with fresh parsley. This dish pairs well with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh green salad.

Enjoy your clean and delicious Lemon Garlic Herb Grilled Chicken! It's simple, full of flavor, and a real treat for any healthy meal.

Query: I want a cheeseburger but I'm dairy-free and vegetarian. I know this sounds impossible but I'm really craving the taste and texture of a classic American cheeseburger and I haven't had one in 3 years since I went vegetarian and developed lactose intolerance
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for a dairy-free and vegetarian cheeseburger that will satisfy your cravings! This recipe features a hearty black bean patty topped with dairy-free cheese, providing both the taste and texture reminiscent of a classic cheeseburger. This recipe serves 2.

### Dairy-Free and Vegetarian Cheeseburger

**Ingredients:**

**For the Black Bean Patties:**
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (use gluten-free if necessary)
- 1/4 cup finely chopped onions
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (for cooking)
  
**For Assembly:**
- 2 dairy-free burger buns
- 2 slices dairy-free cheese (such as cashew or almond-based)
- Lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Pickles (optional)
- Ketchup, mustard, or any condiments of your choice

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Black Bean Mixture:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, add the drained and rinsed black beans. Using a fork or a potato masher, mash the beans until mostly smooth, leaving some chunks for texture.
   - Stir in the breadcrumbs, chopped onions, minced garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix everything until well combined. If the mixture feels too wet, add a little more breadcrumbs until it holds together.

2. **Form the Patties:**
   - Divide the mixture into two equal portions and shape them into patties about ½ inch thick. Place them on a plate and refrigerate for about 15 minutes to firm up.

3. **Cook the Patties:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the black bean patties. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on one side until golden brown. Gently flip the patties and cook for another 5-6 minutes, adding a slice of dairy-free cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.

4. **Toast the Buns:**
   - While the patties are cooking, you can toast the burger buns. You can do this in a toaster or on a skillet until lightly golden.

This recipe features a hearty black bean patty topped with dairy-free cheese, providing both the taste and texture reminiscent of a classic cheeseburger. This recipe serves 2.

### Dairy-Free and Vegetarian Cheeseburger

**Ingredients:**

**For the Black Bean Patties:**
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (use gluten-free if necessary)
- 1/4 cup finely chopped onions
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (for cooking)
  
**For Assembly:**
- 2 dairy-free burger buns
- 2 slices dairy-free cheese (such as cashew or almond-based)
- Lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Pickles (optional)
- Ketchup, mustard, or any condiments of your choice

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Black Bean Mixture:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, add the drained and rinsed black beans. Using a fork or a potato masher, mash the beans until mostly smooth, leaving some chunks for texture.
   - Stir in the breadcrumbs, chopped onions, minced garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix everything until well combined. If the mixture feels too wet, add a little more breadcrumbs until it holds together.

2. **Form the Patties:**
   - Divide the mixture into two equal portions and shape them into patties about ½ inch thick. Place them on a plate and refrigerate for about 15 minutes to firm up.

3. **Cook the Patties:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the black bean patties. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on one side until golden brown. Gently flip the patties and cook for another 5-6 minutes, adding a slice of dairy-free cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.

4. **Toast the Buns:**
   - While the patties are cooking, you can toast the burger buns. You can do this in a toaster or on a skillet until lightly golden.

5. **Assemble the Burgers:**
   - On the bottom half of each toasted bun, place a lettuce leaf followed by a slice of tomato. Carefully place the black bean patty with melted dairy-free cheese on top. Add pickles and your favorite condiments. Finally, crown with the top half of the bun.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve warm, alongside some sweet potato fries or a salad for a complete meal.

Query: My kid needs a nut-free cookie recipe for school but she's super picky and only likes chocolate
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: **Nut-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies**  
*Serving Size: Makes 12-15 cookies*

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (or use a dairy-free spread if needed)
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (ensure they're nut-free)

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure your cookies bake evenly.

2. **Mix the Dry Ingredients**: In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. This helps to evenly distribute the baking soda and gives your cookies a nice rise.

3. **Cream the Butter and Sugars**: In a large mixing bowl, add the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Using an electric mixer (or a whisk if you're up for it), beat these ingredients together until the mixture is light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.

4. **Add the Egg and Vanilla**: Once your butter and sugars are creamy, add in the egg and vanilla extract. Continue mixing until everything is well combined.

5. **Incorporate the Dry Ingredients**: Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture into the wet mixture. Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon just until combined. Be careful not to over-mix, or your cookies might turn out dense.

6. **Fold in the Chocolate Chips**: Gently fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips. This is where all the chocolate goodness comes in!

7. **Shape the Cookies**: Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded balls of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure to leave about 2 inches of space between each cookie, as they will spread while baking.

8. **Bake**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes. You'll know they are done when the edges are golden brown, but the centers look slightly soft. 

9. **Cool the Cookies**: Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. After that, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. 

10. **Enjoy**: Your nut-free chocolate chip cookies are now ready to be enjoyed! Store them in an airtight container for freshness.

These cookies are sure to please even the pickiest of eaters!

Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious Gluten-Light recipe for you: **Quinoa Salad with Roasted Vegetables**. This vibrant dish is not only gluten-light, but also packed with nutrients and flavor!

### Quinoa Salad with Roasted Vegetables

**Serving Size: 2**

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)
- 1 medium zucchini, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 medium carrot, diced
- 1 small red onion, diced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). This will allow the vegetables to roast to a perfect golden brown.

2. **Prepare Quinoa**: Rinse the quinoa under cold water using a fine mesh sieve. This helps to remove any bitterness. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth (or water). Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Fluff the quinoa with a fork and set aside to cool.

3. **Roast the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the vegetables. On a baking sheet, toss the diced zucchini, red bell pepper, carrot, and red onion with olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder. Spread them out evenly on the sheet. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they are tender and slightly caramelized, stirring halfway through to ensure even cooking.

4. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa and the roasted vegetables. Add in the chopped parsley if you’re using it for an extra burst of freshness.

5. **Dress the Salad**: Squeeze the juice of one lemon over the quinoa and vegetable mixture. Toss everything together gently to combine, ensuring the lemon juice is evenly distributed.

6. **Serve**: Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or lemon juice if needed. This salad can be enjoyed warm, at room temperature, or even chilled—perfect for meal prep!

Query: Nut-free lunch that's safe for my kid's school
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious and nutritious Nut-Free Turkey and Avocado Wrap that is perfect for a school lunch!

### Nut-Free Turkey and Avocado Wrap

**Serving Size:** 2 Servings

**Ingredients:**
- 2 large whole wheat or spinach tortillas
- 4 slices of deli turkey (or your choice of deli meat)
- 1 ripe avocado
- 1 medium tomato, thinly sliced
- 1 cup of mixed greens (like spinach, romaine, or lettuce)
- 2 tablespoons of cream cheese or hummus (for spreading)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: Slices of cucumber or bell peppers for extra crunch

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Avocado:** Start by cutting the avocado in half, removing the pit, and scooping out the flesh into a medium bowl. Mash it gently with a fork until it reaches a smooth consistency. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper for added flavor.

2. **Spread the Base:** Lay one tortilla flat on a clean surface or cutting board. Take 1 tablespoon of cream cheese or hummus and spread it evenly over the surface of the tortilla. This will add creaminess and help the fillings stick.

3. **Layer the Ingredients:** On top of the spread, lay two slices of turkey. Then, generously spread half of the mashed avocado onto the turkey. Next, add slices of tomato and a handful of mixed greens. If you’re adding cucumber or bell peppers, layer them on now for added crunch.

4. **Wrap It Up:** Starting from one end, carefully lift the tortilla and begin to roll it over the fillings, tucking them in gently as you go. Roll it tightly until you reach the other end of the tortilla. Once fully rolled, you can slice it in half at a diagonal for easier eating.

5. **Repeat:** Repeat the process with the second tortilla and remaining ingredients to make the second wrap.

6. **Serving Suggestions:** You can serve these wraps as they are or with a side of baby carrots, sliced fruits, or a small bag of popcorn for a complete lunch.

### Storage:
- If you're packing these for school, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or in a reusable container to maintain freshness until lunchtime.

Query: I'm dairy-free but pregnant and craving ice cream constantly
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have just the recipe for you! Let’s make a delicious Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream. It’s a creamy, satisfying treat that’s perfect for your ice cream cravings, and it’s quick and easy to prepare.

### Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 ripe bananas
- 1 tablespoon of almond milk (or any dairy-free milk of your choice)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- A pinch of sea salt
- Optional toppings: chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, fresh fruit, or a drizzle of nut butter

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Bananas:**
   - Start by peeling the ripe bananas and slicing them into small rounds. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and creamier your nice cream will be.

2. **Freeze the Bananas:**
   - Place the banana slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze them for about 1-2 hours, or until they are completely solid. This step is crucial for achieving that ice cream-like consistency.

3. **Blend the Ingredients:**
   - Once the banana slices are frozen, remove them from the freezer and place them into a high-speed blender or food processor. Add the almond milk, vanilla extract (if using), and a pinch of sea salt for flavor.

4. **Blend Till Smooth:**
   - Blend the mixture on high until it becomes creamy and smooth. You may need to pause and scrape down the sides of the blender or processor a couple of times to ensure everything is evenly blended. This should take about 1-2 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.

5. **Taste and Adjust:**
   - Give your nice cream a taste. If you want it sweeter, you can add a little maple syrup or honey (if not strictly vegan) and blend again.

6. **Serve:**
   - Scoop the nice cream into two bowls. If desired, top with your choice of toppings such as chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, fresh fruit, or a drizzle of nut butter.

7. **Enjoy Immediately:**
   - This nice cream is best enjoyed right away while it's soft and creamy, but you can also transfer any leftovers to a container and freeze them for up to a week. Just let it soften a bit on the counter before serving later.

This Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream is not only delicious but also full of nutrients from the bananas. Enjoy your healthy treat!

Let’s make a delicious Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream. It’s a creamy, satisfying treat that’s perfect for your ice cream cravings, and it’s quick and easy to prepare.

### Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 ripe bananas
- 1 tablespoon of almond milk (or any dairy-free milk of your choice)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- A pinch of sea salt
- Optional toppings: chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, fresh fruit, or a drizzle of nut butter

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Bananas:**
   - Start by peeling the ripe bananas and slicing them into small rounds. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and creamier your nice cream will be.

2. **Freeze the Bananas:**
   - Place the banana slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze them for about 1-2 hours, or until they are completely solid. This step is crucial for achieving that ice cream-like consistency.

3. **Blend the Ingredients:**
   - Once the banana slices are frozen, remove them from the freezer and place them into a high-speed blender or food processor. Add the almond milk, vanilla extract (if using), and a pinch of sea salt for flavor.

4. **Blend Till Smooth:**
   - Blend the mixture on high until it becomes creamy and smooth. You may need to pause and scrape down the sides of the blender or processor a couple of times to ensure everything is evenly blended. This should take about 1-2 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.

5. **Taste and Adjust:**
   - Give your nice cream a taste. If you want it sweeter, you can add a little maple syrup or honey (if not strictly vegan) and blend again.

6. **Serve:**
   - Scoop the nice cream into two bowls. If desired, top with your choice of toppings such as chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, fresh fruit, or a drizzle of nut butter.

7. **Enjoy Immediately:**
   - This nice cream is best enjoyed right away while it's soft and creamy, but you can also transfer any leftovers to a container and freeze them for up to a week. Just let it soften a bit on the counter before serving later.

This Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream is not only delicious but also full of nutrients from the bananas. Enjoy your healthy treat!",text/plain,I'm dairy-free but pregnant and craving ice cream constantly

Query: Vegan protein smoothie that doesn't taste chalky
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious recipe for a **Creamy Vegan Protein Smoothie** that is not only nutritious but also ensures a smooth, tasty experience without the chalkiness that can sometimes accompany protein powders. This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
- 1 ripe banana (frozen for best results)
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any non-dairy milk of your choice)
- 2 tablespoons almond butter (or peanut butter)
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup (optional, adjust based on sweetness preference)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A handful of spinach (optional, for added nutrition)
- Ice cubes (optional, depending on your desired consistency)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare Ingredients:**
   - If you haven't done so already, freeze a ripe banana overnight. This will make the smoothie creamier and cooler. 

2. **Blend the Base:**
   - In a blender, combine the frozen banana, almond milk, and almond butter. These ingredients will form the creamy base of your smoothie. Blend on high until smooth and well-combined.

3. **Add Nutrition:**
   - Next, add the chia seeds, maple syrup (if using), vanilla extract, and spinach. Chia seeds add protein and healthy fats, while spinach boosts the nutrient profile without altering the taste significantly. Blend again until everything is well incorporated and the spinach is completely mixed in.

4. **Adjust Consistency:**
   - If the smoothie is too thick for your liking, add a little more almond milk until you reach the desired consistency. If you prefer a colder drink, throw in a few ice cubes and blend again.

5. **Taste Test:**
   - Stop blending and give it a taste. If you’d like it sweeter, add a bit more maple syrup and blend briefly to combine.

6. **Serve:**
   - Pour the smoothie into glasses and enjoy immediately. You can garnish with a sprinkle of chia seeds or a drizzle of almond butter on top if desired.

### Tips:
- Feel free to substitute the almond milk with soy milk or oat milk for a creamier texture or if you have nut allergies.
- You can add a scoop of your favorite plant-based protein powder if you're looking to increase protein content without affecting the flavor much.
- For added texture and nutrition, consider throwing in some oats or flaxseeds!

Query: Gluten-free birthday cake for my 5-year-old who has celiac but all her friends will be eating regular cake and I don't want her to feel left out
Dietary Restriction: gluten-free
Recipe Response: **Gluten-Free Vanilla Birthday Cake**

This delightful gluten-free vanilla birthday cake is sure to bring a smile to your 5-year-old's face and make her feel special on her birthday, while still being delicious for her friends!

**Serving Size:** 8 servings

### Ingredients

**For the Cake:**
- 1 ½ cups gluten-free all-purpose flour blend (ensure it contains xanthan gum)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (plus more for greasing)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy, as preferred)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

**For the Frosting:**
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2-4 tablespoons milk (dairy or non-dairy, as preferred)
- Optional: colorful sprinkles for decoration

### Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with butter and lightly dust them with gluten-free flour or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together until well combined. Set aside.

3. **Cream the Butter and Sugar:**
   In a large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. **Add Eggs and Vanilla:**
   Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, add the vanilla extract and mix until just combined.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Do not over-mix—it's okay if a few lumps remain.

6. **Pour into Pans:**
   Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula.

7. **Bake the Cakes:**
   Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The cakes should be lightly golden and spring back when touched.

8. **Cool Down:**
   Once baked, remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. **Prepare the Frosting:**
   While the cakes cool, make the frosting. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with a hand mixer or stand mixer on medium speed until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until well incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and enough milk to reach your desired frosting consistency.

10. **Assemble the Cake:**
    Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top. Place the second layer on top and apply a thin coat of frosting over the entire cake (this is called a crumb coat). Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes, then frost the cake again until smooth and fluffy.

11. **Decorate:**
    If desired, decorate with colorful sprinkles and any other fun decorations to make it festive for the birthday celebration.

12. **Serve:**
    Slice the cake into wedges and enjoy with friends! Your gluten-free birthday cake is ready to shine at the celebration.

This cake not only looks fantastic but tastes amazing, ensuring your daughter feels included and loved on her special day! Enjoy!

   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with butter and lightly dust them with gluten-free flour or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together until well combined. Set aside.

3. **Cream the Butter and Sugar:**
   In a large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. **Add Eggs and Vanilla:**
   Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, add the vanilla extract and mix until just combined.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Do not over-mix—it's okay if a few lumps remain.

6. **Pour into Pans:**
   Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula.

7. **Bake the Cakes:**
   Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The cakes should be lightly golden and spring back when touched.

8. **Cool Down:**
   Once baked, remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. **Prepare the Frosting:**
   While the cakes cool, make the frosting. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with a hand mixer or stand mixer on medium speed until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until well incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and enough milk to reach your desired frosting consistency.

10. **Assemble the Cake:**
    Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top. Place the second layer on top and apply a thin coat of frosting over the entire cake (this is called a crumb coat). Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes, then frost the cake again until smooth and fluffy.

11. **Decorate:**
    If desired, decorate with colorful sprinkles and any other fun decorations to make it festive for the birthday celebration.

12. **Serve:**
    Slice the cake into wedges and enjoy with friends! Your gluten-free birthday cake is ready to shine at the celebration.

Query: I want something light but filling
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: **Recipe: Quinoa and Vegetable Salad**

*Serving Size: 2 People*

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water or vegetable broth
- 1 medium cucumber, diced
- 1 medium bell pepper (any color), diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: Feta cheese or avocado for topping

### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Start by rinsing 1 cup of quinoa under cold running water in a fine-mesh sieve. This helps remove the natural coating, called saponin, that can make the quinoa taste bitter.

2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of water (or vegetable broth for extra flavor). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce to low heat, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork afterwards.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooking, take the opportunity to chop your vegetables. Dice the cucumber, bell pepper, and finely chop the red onion. Halve the cherry tomatoes. Place all these chopped veggies into a large mixing bowl.

4. **Mix the Dressing**: In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This will create a light, zesty dressing for your salad.

5. **Combine the Ingredients**: Once the quinoa is cooked and has cooled slightly, add it to the bowl with the chopped vegetables. Pour the dressing over the quinoa and vegetables, then sprinkle in the chopped parsley. Mix everything together gently, ensuring that the dressing evenly coats all the ingredients.

6. **Serve**: Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or lemon juice if desired. If you like, you can top the salad with crumbled feta cheese or sliced avocado for additional flavor and creaminess.

7. **Enjoy**: Serve the quinoa and vegetable salad immediately or chill it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes for a refreshing cold treat. This salad is not only light and nutritious but also very filling, making it a perfect meal!

Query: Halal BBQ recipe for summer
Dietary Restriction: halal
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious recipe for **Halal Grilled Chicken Skewers** that’s perfect for summer BBQs. This recipe will serve 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice (freshly squeezed)
- 1 tablespoon garlic (minced)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- Wooden skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes, if using)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken**:
   - Start by cutting the chicken breasts into 1-inch cubes. This size allows for quick and even cooking on the grill.

2. **Marinate the Chicken**:
   - In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, ground coriander, salt, and black pepper. Whisk the ingredients together until well combined.
   - Add the chicken cubes to the marinade and toss until all the pieces are well-coated. 
   - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the chicken to a sealed bag. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, or longer if you have time. This will enhance the flavor and tenderness.

3. **Prepare the Skewers**:
   - If you are using wooden skewers, make sure they have been soaked in water for 30 minutes to prevent burning on the grill. You can also use metal skewers, which don’t require soaking.
   - After marinating, thread the marinated chicken pieces onto the skewers. Ensure they are packed tightly but not overcrowded.

4. **Preheat the Grill**:
   - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using a charcoal grill, allow the coals to turn gray and ashy.

5. **Grill the Skewers**:
   - Once the grill is hot, lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking. Place the chicken skewers on the grill.
   - Grill the chicken skewers for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has nice grill marks. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).

6. **Serve**:
   - Once cooked, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute within the chicken.
   - Serve the skewers with a side of grilled vegetables or a fresh salad, and perhaps a drizzle of tahini sauce or garlic yogurt for an extra layer of flavor.

Enjoy your Halal Grilled Chicken Skewers as a delightful and flavorful addition to your summer BBQ!

- 1 moderate zucchini, sliced into half-moons
- 1 bell pepper (any color), sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 teaspoon paprika (optional)
- Fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of olive oil, fresh lemon juice, garlic powder, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. 
   - Add the chicken breasts to the marinade, making sure they are well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours for more flavor).

2. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

3. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - On a large baking sheet, toss the zucchini, bell pepper, and broccoli florets with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil, salt, pepper, and paprika (if using). Spread them out in an even layer.

4. **Roast the Vegetables:**
   - Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and starting to caramelize. Stir halfway through to ensure even cooking.

5. **Grill the Chicken:**
   - While the vegetables roast, preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat.
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade and place it on the hot grill. Grill for about 6-7 minutes per side until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F or 75°C) and has nice grill marks. 

6. **Serve:**
   - Once the chicken is cooked and the vegetables are roasted, plate the dish. Slice the chicken, arrange it over the roasted vegetables, and garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of freshness.

Query: Healthy dessert that doesn't taste healthy
Dietary Restriction: sugar-free
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here's a delicious recipe for **Chocolate Avocado Mousse** that serves 2 people. This dessert is rich, creamy, and incredibly satisfying, yet it’s made with wholesome ingredients.

### Ingredients:
- 1 ripe avocado
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup (adjust for sweetness)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 pinch of sea salt
- 2 tablespoons coconut milk (or any milk of your choice)
- Fresh berries (for serving, optional)
- Shredded coconut (for garnish, optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Avocado**: Start by cutting the ripe avocado in half. Remove the pit and scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender.

2. **Add the Cocoa Powder**: To the avocado, add the unsweetened cocoa powder. This will provide the rich chocolate flavor that will mask the taste of the avocado.

3. **Sweeten It Up**: Pour in the honey or maple syrup, depending on your preference for sweetness. Remember, you can adjust the amount later if you want it sweeter!

4. **Flavor It**: Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of sea salt. The salt enhances the flavors and balances the sweetness.

5. **Blend Until Smooth**: Pour in the coconut milk to help achieve a creamy consistency. Blend all the ingredients until completely smooth and silky. Scrape down the sides if needed to make sure everything is well combined.

6. **Taste and Adjust**: Give your mousse a taste. If you desire more sweetness, feel free to add a bit more honey or maple syrup. Blend again briefly to mix.

7. **Chill**: Transfer the mousse to serving dishes (small bowls or glasses). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the mousse to thicken.

8. **Serve**: Once chilled, you can garnish your chocolate avocado mousse with fresh berries and a sprinkle of shredded coconut for an extra touch of flavor and texture.

### Enjoy!
This silky Chocolate Avocado Mousse is a delightful dessert that's packed with healthy fats and nutrients, yet it feels indulgent. Perfect for satisfying that sweet tooth without any guilt!

Query: My kid needs a nut-free cookie recipe for school but she's super picky and only likes chocolate
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Absolutely! Here's a simple and delicious nut-free chocolate cookie recipe that's sure to please even the pickiest eaters. This recipe makes about 12 cookies, perfect for 2 people or for a small batch to share.

### Nut-Free Chocolate Cookies

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (or use a dairy-free alternative if needed)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips (make sure they are nut-free)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.

2. **Prepare the Baking Sheet:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will help prevent the cookies from sticking and make for easy cleanup.

3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt until they are well combined. This helps distribute the leavening agents evenly throughout the flour.

4. **Cream Butter and Sugars:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Using an electric mixer or a sturdy whisk, beat them together until the mixture is light and fluffy—about 2-3 minutes.

5. **Add Egg and Vanilla:** Beat in the egg and vanilla extract to the butter and sugar mixture. Continue mixing until fully incorporated.

6. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed or by hand just until combined. Do not overmix!

7. **Fold in Chocolate Chips:** Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula. Make sure they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

8. **Scoop Cookies:** Using a tablespoon or a cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie for spreading.

9. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. They will continue to firm up as they cool.

10. **Cool the Cookies:** Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Serving Suggestions:
These cookies taste best when served warm, but they can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week. Enjoy with a glass of cold milk or a warm cup of tea!

These Nut-Free Chocolate Cookies are rich, chocolatey, and sure to be a hit at school! Enjoy baking!
