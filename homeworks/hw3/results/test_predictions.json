While a pescatarian diet allows fish and seafood, it excludes meat and poultry. If the provided recipe includes any form of shellfish, such as shrimp, crab, or lobster, it would fail to adhere to the individual's stated dietary restriction due to their shellfish sensitivity. Additionally, if the recipe does not specify which types of fish or seafood are included and potentially includes shellfish, it would also fail. Thus, any ambiguity or inclusion of shellfish leads to non-compliance with the dietary needs.","1":"The recipe response was not provided, making it impossible to evaluate whether the recipe adheres to the Whole30 dietary restrictions. Whole30 prohibits the use of grains, dairy, legumes, refined sugar, alcohol, and processed foods. To accurately determine compliance, the recipe's listed ingredients and preparation methods need to be reviewed. Without the specifics, we cannot ensure the recipe meets Whole30 guidelines.","2":"The recipe response for a sugar-free dessert must avoid any added sugars or high-sugar ingredients. While the recipe does not explicitly list any ingredients, it is essential to ensure that each component used must adhere strictly to being sugar-free. Without the ingredients or methods being clearly outlined, there's no assurance that high-sugar elements or sugar substitutes that impact glycemic levels are avoided. For a sugar-free recipe, it\u2019s crucial that all sweeteners used have no or negligible impact on blood sugar, such as erythritol, stevia, or similar substitutes. The absence of an explicit ingredient list or instructions makes it impossible to verify compliance with the sugar-free restriction.","3":"The query requests a 'keto-ish' recipe, indicating a preference for a recipe that aligns with keto principles but is not super strict. However, the dietary restriction specified is keto, which typically requires a very low carbohydrate intake, usually under 20g of net carbs per day. Without the actual recipe response provided, it's challenging to evaluate specific ingredients or methods. However, considering the request's wording, it is likely that the recipe might not strictly adhere to typical keto restrictions, which often exclude higher carb ingredients and favor high fat and moderate protein content. Therefore, in the absence of precise details, the recipe may not fully align with the strict keto dietary expectations, given the 'keto-ish' description.","4":"The provided low-carb pizza recipe adheres to the low-carb dietary restriction. The recipe substitutes traditional wheat flour with almond flour, which is low in carbohydrates and suitable for a low-carb diet. Additionally, the use of mozzarella cheese and a minimal amount of tomato sauce keeps the carbohydrate content low. The toppings such as pepperoni, olives, and vegetables do not add significant carbohydrates, making the entire dish appropriate for a low-carb diet. Overall, the recipe successfully recreates the pizza experience while maintaining a low carbohydrate profile, making it suitable for those following a low-carb diet.","5":"The recipe provided for a diabetic-friendly dessert adheres to the diabetic-friendly dietary restriction as it avoids artificial sweeteners while focusing on natural ingredients with a low glycemic index. By not including artificial sweeteners, it aligns with the request and instead ensures the use of ingredients that can be part of a controlled carbohydrate diet suitable for managing blood sugar levels. The recipe exercises care in ingredient selection that supports diabetic dietary needs, making it suitable for individuals with diabetes as it respects their dietary considerations.","6":"The response lacks specific detail about the dietary evaluation needed, assuming an {attributes.output.value} placeholder. However, the response should include a full recipe to evaluate. When considering a vegetarian meal suitable for a bodybuilder, particular attention should be given to protein sources like tofu, tempeh, legumes, eggs, dairy, or plant-based protein powders to ensure adequate protein content. Without specific ingredients or methods provided, it's impossible to verify adherence to vegetarian dietary restrictions or ensure adequate protein content for bodybuilding. The evaluation fails due to insufficient information.","7":"The recipe response is missing, so I cannot evaluate if it adheres to the keto dietary restriction. A keto diet requires very low carbohydrate intake, typically less than 20g of net carbs per day, and emphasizes high fat and moderate protein. Without specific information on the ingredients and instructions, it is impossible to determine whether the provided recipe meets the keto criteria.","8":"A raw vegan salad must consist only of plant-based ingredients that are not heated above 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C). However, the recipe suggests incorporating 'cooked quinoa,' which violates raw vegan principles since cooking involves heating beyond the limit set by raw vegan guidelines. Furthermore, the optional inclusion of feta cheese is incompatible with a vegan diet, as it is a dairy product derived from animals. To adhere properly to raw vegan requirements, the recipe should exclude cooked ingredients and any non-vegan components, ensuring all elements remain both plant-based and uncooked or raw.","9":"The recipe response for 'Paleo spaghetti and meatballs' likely contains ingredients such as traditional pasta and breadcrumbs that are not allowed on a Paleo diet. A Paleo diet restricts grains, legumes, and processed foods. Traditional spaghetti is made from wheat, which is a grain and not compliant with Paleo guidelines. Similarly, breadcrumbs, often used in meatballs, are made from bread, which contains grains. Alternative Paleo-friendly options such as zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash for the pasta and almond flour or coconut flour as a binder in meatballs are not mentioned. Additionally, the recipe response does not provide details on the type of meat used or the cooking method, which could further violate Paleo principles if not properly adhered to. Without specific details ensuring that every ingredient and method aligns with Paleo requirements, the recipe is inadequate for a Paleo dietary restriction.","10":"The term 'keto-ish' suggests that the recipe is not strictly adhering to a keto diet, which requires very low carbohydrates (typically < 20g net carbs per day), high fat, and moderate protein. If the recipe is only 'keto-ish,' it implies that it might contain ingredients or quantities that exceed keto-friendly carbohydrate limits. Without specifics on the ingredients or methods used, it is impossible to ensure that the recipe remains within the strict carbohydrate limits required by a keto diet. Therefore, because the recipe does not adhere to the strict keto guidelines, it fails to meet the specified dietary restriction of keto.","11":"The query seeks a vegan and gluten-free dietary solution, while indicating a dislike for vegetables. A recipe or dietary suggestion for vegan and gluten-free that ignores vegetables yet remains balanced is challenging. However, the absence of a specific recipe or recommendation leaves this request unaddressed. The response does not provide any meal ideas, alternatives, or strategies for dealing with the aversion to vegetables while maintaining the dual restrictions of veganism and gluten-free. For a PASS, the response would need to suggest specific vegan and gluten-free foods or recipes that do not heavily rely on vegetables, such as those based on legumes, grains like quinoa, gluten-free oats, or products made with nut-based or soy-based ingredients. Additionally, it should address nutrient balance, considering the frequent reliance on vegetables in vegan diets.","12":"The query requests a recipe suitable for a vegan diet, which excludes all animal products, including honey. Although honey is mentioned in the context of seeking a substitute, the core request is for a vegan-friendly yogurt breakfast. The main ingredient typically used in yogurt is dairy, which is not vegan. The suggestion implicitly fails to directly address the need for a vegan yogurt alternative. For the query to pass, it should explicitly suggest a plant-based yogurt (such as those made from soy, almond, or coconut milk) and a vegan-friendly sweetener as a honey substitute, such as maple syrup or agave nectar. Without addressing these specifics and ensuring all ingredients are explicitly vegan, the response fails to meet the strict definition of a vegan dietary restriction.","13":"The recipe response to create a vegan chocolate cake with the additional constraint of avoiding refined sugar is incomplete as it does not provide any specific ingredients or instructions. Without a detailed recipe, it's impossible to evaluate whether it adheres to a vegan diet and avoids refined sugar. To comply with a vegan dietary restriction, the recipe must ensure there are no animal products like dairy, eggs, or honey. Additionally, to avoid refined sugar, the recipe should use natural sweeteners like maple syrup, agave nectar, or dates instead of white or brown sugar. As neither the recipe details nor the ingredients are provided, we cannot confirm adherence to these dietary needs.","14":"The recipe response is intended for a vegetarian and dairy-free cheeseburger, yet it describes a classic American cheeseburger without any ingredient substitutions or modifications to adhere to the dietary restrictions. For a vegetarian cheeseburger, a suitable meat alternative like a veggie patty or plant-based protein source, such as mushrooms or lentils, should replace the meat. Moreover, the recipe needs to use dairy-free cheese to replace traditional cheese to accommodate the dairy-free requirement. Without any clear mention of these adjustments, the recipe response does not meet the specified dietary preferences of being both vegetarian and dairy-free.","15":"The request specifies adherence to the paleo diet, which avoids processed foods, grains, legumes, dairy, and refined sugar. However, the query indicates avoidance of processed foods while expressing a preference for simplicity, which may lead to a recipe suggestion that could include non-paleo ingredients, particularly if the 'lazy' aspect is prioritized over strict adherence to paleo guidelines. Without explicit details of the recipe response, ingredients or methods that may violate paleo restrictions, like the inclusion of grains, legumes, or dairy, are possible. Therefore, the recipe is considered to potentially violate paleo dietary guidelines until further specifics confirm compliance.","16":"The query specifies a pescatarian diet with a sensitivity to shellfish. A proper recipe response should not include any shellfish, adhering to the pescatarian guidelines (no meat except fish and seafood) while taking into account the individual's shellfish intolerance. Without information on the recipe response provided, it cannot be determined whether the shellfish sensitivity has been appropriately considered. Therefore, the recipe response fails the dietary restriction evaluation since it does not explicitly address or omit shellfish to accommodate the specified dietary need. To pass, the response should ensure that no shellfish is present and only allowable seafood such as fish is included in the recipe.","17":"The recipe response is evaluated for adherence to kosher dietary restrictions for Passover, a period that requires additional dietary constraints beyond standard kosher laws. Typically, during Passover, leavened grain products (chametz) and those derived from wheat, barley, rye, oats, and spelt that are not specifically kosher for Passover are prohibited. The recipe does not provide explicit assurances that all ingredients and preparation methods comply with these restrictions. For a recipe to pass the kosher criteria for Passover, it must specify the use of ingredients designated as 'kosher for Passover,' such as specific types of flour like matzo meal or specific sweeteners and leavening agents that are acceptable during this holiday. Without these specifications, it cannot be confirmed that the recipe is appropriate for kosher dietary laws during Passover.","18":"The recipe for a vegetarian diet must exclude all meat and fish, but may include dairy and eggs. Since there is no recipe provided in the response, it is impossible to evaluate it for adherence to vegetarian dietary restrictions. For a valid evaluation, a recipe with specific ingredients and preparation methods is necessary to ensure it contains no meat or fish and includes permissible vegetarian ingredients.","19":"The recipe request specifies a vegetarian dietary restriction, emphasizing a preference for avoiding vegetables but still wanting to eat healthy. To adhere to a vegetarian diet, the recipe must exclude meat and fish but can include dairy and eggs. However, since the request mentions a dislike for vegetables, the recipe should creatively incorporate vegetarian-friendly foods that are rich in nutrients without relying heavily on vegetables. Examples include dishes with grains, legumes, dairy, eggs, and other vegetarian proteins like tofu or tempeh. Without specific ingredients or methods provided in the recipe response, it is difficult to ascertain its suitability for a vegetarian diet while respecting the preference to avoid vegetables. Therefore, without these details, it fails to meet the dietary requirements and personal preferences specified.","20":"The recipe response does not specify any ingredients or preparation methods, making it impossible to verify adherence to a nut-free dietary restriction. To accurately evaluate the recipe, the ingredient list and cooking instructions must be provided to ensure no tree nuts or peanuts are included. Without this information, it cannot be confirmed that the recipe meets nut-free criteria for a school-safe lunch.","21":"The recipe response does not adequately address the raw vegan dietary restriction. While the ingredients provided, such as tomatoes, cucumber, avocado, and fresh herbs, are suitable for a raw vegan diet, the inclusion of any vinegar is questionable as some vinegars, like balsamic, may be heated or cooked during production, which could exceed the 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C) limit for raw foods. Additionally, the response does not specify preparation methods that ensure no ingredients are subjected to heat, which is essential for maintaining raw vegan compliance. To fully adhere to a raw vegan diet, every ingredient and method should be clearly defined as raw-friendly without assumptions left to the reader.","22":"The dietary restriction specified is pescatarian, but with an added specification of avoiding shellfish due to an intolerance. The recipe would need to strictly ensure no shellfish is included. However, without the recipe provided, I cannot evaluate the specific ingredients or methods used. The query indicates an important condition (avoiding shellfish) that needs to be addressed, so any inclusion of shellfish would directly violate the dietary restriction specified, leading to a FAIL evaluation if present.","23":"The stated dietary restriction is pescatarian, which allows for the consumption of fish and seafood in addition to vegetarian foods. Since the query mentions eating fish sometimes and is mostly vegetarian, this aligns with the pescatarian diet. However, evaluation of a specific recipe is not possible due to missing details from the given 'Recipe Response' placeholder. Assuming the recipe includes no incompatible ingredients (like meat or other non-pescatarian items), it would generally adhere to the pescatarian diet as described in the query.","24":"The recipe response is missing and therefore does not provide any details or ingredients to evaluate for low-carb dietary adherence. A low-carb diet typically requires significantly reduced carbohydrates, often less than 50g per day. Without any information on specific ingredients or nutritional content, we cannot assess whether the recipe meets the low-carb criteria. Additionally, without details on possible high-carb ingredients frequently found in recipes (such as starchy vegetables, grains, sugars, or fruits), it is impossible to ensure adherence to the low-carb dietary restriction.","25":"The query specifies a vegan dietary restriction but expresses a desire to use honey, which is not considered vegan as it is an animal product. For a properly vegan recipe, honey should be substituted with a plant-based alternative like agave nectar or maple syrup. Furthermore, since the query also craves a yogurt breakfast, it's important that any yogurt used in the recipe be made from non-dairy alternatives such as almond, coconut, or soy milk to adhere to vegan guidelines. Overall, the interest in using honey and the lack of explicit mention of a non-dairy yogurt alternative do not fulfill the vegan dietary restriction.","26":"The query asks for a raw vegan salad, which means all ingredients must be vegan and not heated above 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C). However, the recipe response includes 'wilted spinach,' which implies the spinach is cooked, typically involving heat above raw vegan guidelines. Furthermore, certain terms or preparation methods such as 'boiled' or heated ingredients could have been inadvertent, but since the query specifically requests a raw vegan option, anything involving cooking or heating would contradict the raw vegan requirement. Additionally, with no explicit recipe provided in your query input to evaluate, it's vital any melted or cooked elements are strictly avoided based on your specification.","27":"The recipe response is missing. Without the details of the recipe, I cannot evaluate its adherence to the sugar-free dietary restriction. To properly assess whether the recipe qualifies as sugar-free, I need to know the specific ingredients and methods used in the dessert. If the recipe includes any form of added sugar or high-sugar ingredients, it would fail the sugar-free restriction. Please provide the recipe details for a complete evaluation.","28":"The recipe response is not provided, so I am unable to evaluate whether it adheres to the Whole30 dietary restriction. Whole30 prohibits grains, dairy, legumes, sugar, alcohol, and processed foods. Without specific information about the ingredients and preparation methods used in the recipe, it is not possible to ensure adherence to these guidelines.","29":"The request is for a recipe that adheres to both dairy-free and vegetarian restrictions while resembling a classic American cheeseburger. A traditional cheeseburger includes beef (non-vegetarian) and cheese (not dairy-free). To meet these restrictions, a vegetarian and dairy-free cheeseburger could use a grilled plant-based patty or a homemade veggie burger, along with dairy-free cheese alternatives. However, without knowing the specific recipe response provided, I cannot confirm adherence. Given the context, if the response didn't incorporate these key substitutions and description details, it would fail to meet the requirements for a vegetarian, dairy-free cheeseburger reminiscent of a classic American cheeseburger.","30":"The recipe needs to be evaluated for possible contamination or traces of nuts. Since only general nut-free guidance is provided, it doesn't ensure avoidance of potential cross-contamination which is critical in nut-free cooking. Furthermore, there is no explicit mention of ensuring all ingredients, like chocolate chips, are certified nut-free, which is essential given the dietary restriction specified.","31":"The recipe response is labeled as 'gluten-light,' indicating that it is not entirely free of gluten, which does not adhere to the specified 'gluten-free' dietary restriction. While some individuals with a gluten sensitivity may tolerate small amounts of gluten, a recipe strictly adhering to a gluten-free requirement must ensure that all ingredients are devoid of gluten and are not subject to cross-contamination. Ingredients such as flour, bread, and any processed ingredients must be certified gluten-free. Without explicit confirmation of the gluten-free status of all ingredients and the absence of potential cross-contamination, the recipe cannot be considered compliant with a strict gluten-free diet.","32":"Unfortunately, I can't assess the nut-free compliance of the recipe response because no specific recipe details or ingredients were provided. To evaluate if a lunch is truly nut-free, the response must detail the ingredients and preparation methods to ensure that no tree nuts or peanuts are included directly or through cross-contamination. Without this information, it is impossible to determine adherence to the nut-free dietary restriction.","33":"No recipe was provided in the response, so I cannot evaluate it for adherence to the dairy-free restriction. A suitable dairy-free ice cream recipe would typically use plant-based milk alternatives, such as almond milk, coconut milk, or oat milk, and avoid any dairy-derived ingredients like milk, cream, or butter. Without any specific recipe details, I cannot confirm adherence to the dietary requirement specified.","34":"The evaluation cannot be determined accurately as the recipe content is missing ('{attributes.output.value}'). A proper evaluation requires access to both the explicit ingredients and the preparation methods in order to assess compliance with the low-carb dietary restriction, which typically demands significantly reduced carbohydrates, often less than 50g per day. Without the specific recipe details, it is impossible to ascertain whether the recipe adheres to these dietary needs.","35":"The evaluation cannot be completed as the 'recipe response' is missing. To evaluate whether the recipe adheres to the vegan dietary restriction, I need the full details of the recipe, including the list of ingredients and preparation methods, to ensure that no animal products such as meat, dairy, eggs, or honey are included. Without this information, it is impossible to determine whether the recipe is suitable for a vegan diet.","36":"Unfortunately, the provided context for evaluation does not include the actual recipe response for a raw vegan dessert. Without details on the ingredients or preparation methods, it's impossible to verify compliance with raw vegan dietary restrictions. Typically, a raw vegan dessert should include ingredients that are plant-based and not heated above 118\u00b0F (48\u00b0C). Without specific details on the recipe, such as the types of sweeteners used, potential use of processed ingredients, or cooking methods involved, a proper evaluation cannot be conducted. Therefore, due to lack of information, the recipe must be marked as FAIL until a detailed review is possible.","37":"The request is for a gluten-free birthday cake suitable for a child with celiac disease. To be labeled as gluten-free, the recipe must ensure that all ingredients are free of gluten and avoid cross-contamination. Common gluten-free ingredients like almond flour, coconut flour, or a certified gluten-free baking mix could be used as substitutes for wheat flour. Additionally, all other ingredients such as baking powder, vanilla extract, and any flavoring or decorations should be certified gluten-free. The provided recipe does not include specific ingredient details or mention of gluten-free certification, which is essential for such a dietary need. Therefore, the recipe does not meet the criteria specified for a strict gluten-free diet necessary for someone with celiac disease.","38":"The response does not contain a recipe to evaluate for low-carb adherence. To assess its compliance, a full list of ingredients and preparation methods should be outlined to ensure they align with low-carb dietary restrictions. Without specific ingredients or methods provided in the output, it is not possible to determine if the recipe aligns with a low-carb diet. Therefore, it fails to meet the dietary restriction criteria described.","39":"Unfortunately, I cannot provide a 'pass' or 'fail' evaluation for the specified halal BBQ recipe because the actual recipe content has been marked as missing or unavailable ({attributes.output.value}). To assess whether a recipe adheres to halal dietary restrictions, specific details regarding the ingredients and preparation methods are necessary. Halal dietary laws require meat to be sourced from animals slaughtered according to Islamic guidelines, no pork or alcohol should be included, and potential cross-contamination with non-halal ingredients must be avoided. A detailed recipe with clear information on meat sourcing, ingredient lists, and preparation steps is essential for determining compliance with halal restrictions.","40":"The recipe provided is labeled as low-carb and adheres well to the low-carb dietary restriction. It uses cauliflower as a base for the crust instead of traditional flour, significantly reducing carbohydrate content. The toppings can be chosen to keep the carbohydrate content low, such as using cheese, vegetables, and meats like pepperoni or chicken, instead of high-carb options like sweetened sauces or certain fruits. The preparation method avoids any high-carb alternatives, aligning with a low-carb diet.","41":"Unfortunately, without the full recipe response provided, I cannot perform a detailed evaluation of whether the recipe adheres to the specified paleo dietary restriction. However, if 'almonds' are included, they are not classified as tree nuts botanically, but they can still be a concern for some individuals with nut allergies. To accurately assess the recipe, it is also crucial to ensure that the recipe excludes all grains, legumes, dairy, refined sugar, and processed foods, per paleo guidelines, and does not contain any other nuts besides almonds. Since the recipe response was not provided here, it is labeled as 'FAIL' due to insufficient information.","42":"The recipe does not specify details about the ingredients or preparation methods, making it impossible to determine if it adheres to the low-sodium dietary restriction. A low-sodium recipe should include specific guidelines for using no-salt or low-sodium ingredients, such as broth, canned vegetables, or seasonings, and should exclude high-sodium ingredients. Without a listed recipe, there is no way to verify the sodium levels or ensure compliance with a low-sodium diet.","43":"The dietary restriction specified is gluten-free, which means that the recipe should not include any gluten-containing ingredients and must ensure the absence of cross-contamination. However, the query specifies a 'gluten-light' recipe, suggesting that it may not strictly avoid all sources of gluten. The term 'gluten-light' implies that the recipe may contain trace amounts of gluten or potential gluten sources, which is not suitable for a strict gluten-free diet. Therefore, without further details that confirm all ingredients are certified gluten-free and cross-contamination is avoided, the recipe fails to meet the gluten-free dietary restriction.","44":"The recipe response does not specify the ingredients or methods used, making it impossible to evaluate whether it adheres to the diabetic-friendly dietary restriction. A diabetic-friendly recipe should include ingredients with a low glycemic index and controlled carbohydrates, and avoid high-sugar ingredients. Without these details, I cannot determine if the recipe meets the necessary requirements for managing blood sugar levels effectively.","45":"To evaluate the recipe response in relation to the Whole30 dietary restriction, which prohibits grains, dairy, legumes, sugar, alcohol, and processed foods, I need specific details about the ingredients and methods used in the recipe response. Without this information, it cannot be confirmed that the recipe adheres to or violates the Whole30 guidelines. Typically, a 'clean' diet can mean different things to different people, and just stating support for a clean diet is insufficient to determine compliance with the stringent Whole30 requirements, which have clearly defined rules against certain food groups and additives.","46":"The recipe response is not provided, so it's difficult to make a direct evaluation. However, any dessert recipe labeled as 'sugar-free' must not include any sources of added sugars, such as honey, maple syrup, regular sugar, or high-sugar fruits. It should use sugar substitutes like erythritol, stevia, or monk fruit sweetener, which don't significantly impact blood glucose levels. The methods should not incorporate any sugary glazes or toppings that could violate the sugar-free restriction. Without specific ingredients or methods listed, the adherence to the sugar-free dietary restriction cannot be verified.","47":"No recipe was provided in the response to evaluate adherence to the nut-free dietary restriction. Without specific ingredients or instructions, it is impossible to assess whether the recipe follows the nut-free requirement, which is crucial for avoiding tree nuts or peanuts. Therefore, the lack of a recipe automatically results in a failure to meet the dietary guideline."},"attributes.query":{"0":"I'm pescatarian but shellfish makes me sick","1":"Whole30 compliant dinner that my non-Whole30 husband will actually eat","2":"Sugar-free dessert that doesn't taste like sadness","3":"Something keto-ish but not super strict","4":"Low-carb pizza recipe - I miss pizza so much","5":"Diabetic-friendly dessert that doesn't use artificial sweeteners","6":"Vegetarian meal that has enough protein for my bodybuilder boyfriend","7":"I'm on keto but I'm craving something sweet.

This recipe serves 2.\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup black beans, drained and rinsed (or 1 can)\n- 1\/2 cup cooked quinoa\n- 1\/4 cup breadcrumbs (use gluten-free if desired)\n- 1\/4 cup diced onion\n- 2 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tsp smoked paprika\n- 1 tsp cumin\n- Salt and pepper, to taste\n- 1 tbsp olive oil (for cooking)\n- 2 slices dairy-free cheese (such as almond or coconut-based)\n- 2 whole grain burger buns (check that they're dairy-free)\n- Lettuce leaves\n- Tomato slices\n- Pickles (optional)\n- Vegan mayo (optional)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Burger Mixture:**\n   - In a medium mixing bowl, mash the black beans with a fork until they are mostly smooth but still have some texture. This will provide the base for your burger.\n   - Add the cooked quinoa, breadcrumbs, diced onion, minced garlic, smoked paprika, and cumin to the mashed beans. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n   - Mix everything together until well combined. If the mixture feels too wet, add a bit more breadcrumbs; if it's too dry, add a splash of water or more cooked quinoa.\n\n2. **Form the Patties:**\n   - Divide the mixture into two equal parts and shape each part into a burger patty. Make sure they\u2019re firm and well-formed to avoid breaking during cooking.\n\n3. **Cook the Patties:**\n   - Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmery, carefully add the patties to the skillet.\n   - Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and heated through. In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of dairy-free cheese on top of each patty. Cover the skillet with a lid to help melt the cheese.\n\n4. **Toast the Buns:**\n   - While the patties are cooking, you can toast the burger buns in a separate pan or a toaster until they are lightly golden. This adds a nice crunch and prevents them from getting soggy.\n\n5. **Assemble the Burgers:**\n   - On the bottom half of each toasted burger bun, place a lettuce leaf, followed by the cheesy black bean quinoa patty. Top it with a slice of tomato, pickles, and a dollop of vegan mayo if desired.
