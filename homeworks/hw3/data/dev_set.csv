Query: I want paleo bread but every recipe I've tried is terrible
Dietary Restriction: paleo
Recipe Response: Let's go for a simple and delicious Paleo Bread recipe that should yield a tasty result! This recipe focuses on basic, healthy ingredients and avoids grains and gluten. The following recipe makes one small loaf, serving approximately 2 people.

### Paleo Almond Flour Bread

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups almond flour
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/4 cup flaxseed meal (ground flaxseeds)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any non-dairy milk)
- 1 tablespoon raw honey (optional for sweetness)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures your bread will bake evenly.

2. **Prepare Your Baking Pan:**
   Line a small loaf pan (about 8x4 inches) with parchment paper, or lightly grease it with coconut oil to prevent sticking.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**
   In a large bowl, sift together the almond flour, coconut flour, flaxseed meal, baking soda, and salt. Mixing these ingredients thoroughly is crucial to ensure even distribution of the leavening agent.

4. **Mix Wet Ingredients:**
   In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs until fully beaten. Add the almond milk, honey (if using), and apple cider vinegar. Mix well until everything is fully combined and smooth.

5. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently stir until the mixture forms a thick batter. Be careful not to overmix; just blend until combined.

6. **Pour and Smooth:**
   Transfer the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Use a spatula to smooth the top, making it as even as possible.

7. **Bake:**
   Place the loaf pan into the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes. The bread is done when it has risen and turned a golden brown color. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.

8. **Cool:**
   Once baked, remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing.

9. **Serve:**
   This Paleo Bread can be enjoyed fresh, toasted, or used as a base for sandwiches. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week.

This recipe should yield a satisfyingly nutty and hearty bread that fits your paleo lifestyle. Enjoy your baking!

Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious recipe for **Cheesy Vegetable Quesadillas** that are nut-free and perfect for a school lunch. This dish is warm, satisfying, and packed with veggies!

### Cheesy Vegetable Quesadillas

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 4 flour tortillas (8-inch size)
- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or mozzarella)
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 1 small zucchini, grated or finely diced
- 1 small carrot, grated
- 1/2 cup corn (frozen or canned, drained)
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (optional)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Salsa or sour cream, for serving (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Veggies:** Start by washing and prepping your vegetables. Dice the bell pepper, grate the zucchini and carrot, and if using frozen corn, thaw it slightly under warm water.

2. **Sauté the Vegetables:** In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced bell pepper, grated zucchini, grated carrot, and corn. Sprinkle in the garlic powder and onion powder (if using), along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for about 3-5 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Remove the skillet from the heat and set the vegetable mixture aside.

3. **Assemble the Quesadillas:** On a clean, flat surface, lay out two tortillas. Evenly distribute the vegetable mixture onto each tortilla, leaving a little space around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded cheese generously over the vegetables, and then top with the remaining two tortillas.

4. **Cook the Quesadillas:** Wipe out the skillet used for the vegetables and return it to the stove over medium heat. Carefully place one quesadilla in the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, or until it’s golden brown and the cheese begins to melt. Use a spatula to flip the quesadilla and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes on the other side.

5. **Repeat with the Second Quesadilla:** After the first quesadilla is cooked, transfer it to a plate. Repeat the cooking process with the second quesadilla.

6. **Cut and Serve:** Once both quesadillas are cooked, remove them from the skillet and let them cool for a minute. Cut them into wedges. Serve warm with salsa or sour cream on the side, if desired.

Dietary Restriction: low-sodium
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious and comforting low-sodium Vegetable Soup recipe that serves 2 people. It's nutritious, hearty, and packed with flavor without the added salt.

### Low-Sodium Vegetable Soup

#### Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium carrot, diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 1 medium potato, peeled and diced
- 1 cup green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces (fresh or frozen)
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 cup diced tomatoes (canned, no salt added)
- Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   Start by washing and chopping all your vegetables as described above. Ensure that your onion, garlic, carrot, celery, potato, green beans, and zucchini are all ready to go.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics:**
   In a medium-sized pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until it's translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute, stirring to prevent it from burning.

3. **Add Harder Vegetables:**
   Stir in the diced carrot, celery, and potato into the pot. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will help to release their natural sweetness.

4. **Incorporate Green Beans and Zucchini:**
   Next, add the green beans and zucchini. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, continuing to stir frequently.

5. **Add Broth and Seasonings:**
   Pour in the low-sodium vegetable broth. Add the dried thyme, dried basil, black pepper, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil.

6. **Simmer:**
   Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the soup simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are tender.

7. **Final Touches:**
   Stir in the canned tomatoes (with their juice) and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you'd like more flavor, consider adding a splash of lemon juice or a sprinkle of vinegar for brightness.

8. **Serve:**
   Remove the bay leaf before serving. Ladle the soup into bowls and, if desired, garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and freshness.

Query: Kosher dessert for Passover
Dietary Restriction: kosher
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for **Flourless Chocolate Cake**, which is perfect for Passover and is sure to please everyone at your table. This rich and decadent cake is naturally gluten-free and can be enjoyed by all. 

### Flourless Chocolate Cake

**Servings:** 2 (but it's rich, so you might want to share with more!)

#### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- Pinch of salt
- Optional: powdered sugar or fresh berries for garnish 

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Prepare an 8-inch round cake pan by greasing it lightly with butter and lining the bottom with parchment paper. This will ensure easy removal after baking.

2. **Melt Chocolate and Butter**: In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the unsalted butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Stir frequently until the mixture is completely melted and smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.

3. **Beat the Eggs**: In a large mixing bowl, crack the three eggs. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla extract. Using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture is thick and pale, about 5 minutes. This step helps to incorporate air for a lighter cake.

4. **Combine the Mixtures**: Once the chocolate and butter mixture has cooled slightly, carefully fold it into the egg mixture. Stir gently until fully combined. Take care not to deflate the mixture too much.

5. **Add Dry Ingredients**: Sift the unsweetened cocoa powder and a pinch of salt over the batter. Gently fold the cocoa into the mix until just combined. The batter will be thick and somewhat glossy.

6. **Pour and Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. The cake is done when the center is set but still slightly gooey.

7. **Cool and Serve**: Once removed from the oven, let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully run a knife around the edges and invert the cake onto a plate. Remove the parchment paper.

8. **Garnish**: Dust with powdered sugar or serve with fresh berries on top for an elegant touch.

9. **Indulge**: Slice the cake into generous wedges and enjoy! It pairs wonderfully with a cup of coffee or tea.

This flourless chocolate cake is a wonderful way to celebrate the sweetness of Passover, offering a rich chocolate flavor with a satisfying texture. Enjoy!

Query: Nut-free lunch that's safe for my kid's school
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious and nut-free recipe for **Cheesy Vegetable Quesadillas** that is perfect for a kid’s school lunch. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 4 small whole wheat tortillas
- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or mozzarella works well)
- 1 cup mixed vegetables (like bell peppers, spinach, and corn)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Salsa (optional, for dipping)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - If you're using fresh vegetables, wash and chop them into small bite-sized pieces. You can use a mix of bell peppers, spinach, and corn for a colorful, nutrient-packed filling. If you have frozen mixed vegetables, just thaw them as per the package instructions.

2. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   - In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
   - Add the chopped vegetables to the skillet. If you're using garlic powder, add it now. 
   - Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes or until they are tender and slightly golden. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Assemble the Quesadillas:**
   - Place one tortilla flat on a clean surface. On one half of the tortilla, sprinkle a layer of shredded cheese (about ¼ cup). Top the cheese with a generous scoop of the sautéed vegetables. Then, sprinkle another layer of cheese on top of the vegetables (this helps to bind everything together). Fold the tortilla over to create a half-moon shape.
   - Repeat this process with the remaining tortillas.

4. **Cook the Quesadillas:**
   - Wipe the skillet clean and return it to the heat, adding a little more olive oil if necessary. You want just enough oil to coat the pan.
   - Carefully place the folded quesadilla in the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the bottom is golden brown and crispy.
   - Flip the quesadilla gently using a spatula, and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes on the other side until it’s golden brown and the cheese is melted.

5. **Slice and Serve:**
   - Once cooked, remove the quesadilla from the skillet and let it sit for a minute. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to slice it into wedges.
   - Serve warm, with a side of salsa for dipping if desired.

### Storage:
These quesadillas can be packed in a lunchbox. If you want to make them ahead of time, simply refrigerate them in an airtight container; they can be enjoyed cold or warmed up in a microwave before serving.

This recipe is a great mix of protein, veggies, and cheesy goodness, making it a tasty and safe option for kids. Enjoy!

Query: I'm dairy-free but pregnant and craving ice cream constantly
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have a delightful recipe for you: Dairy-Free Banana Ice Cream! This treat is not only creamy and delicious but also nutritious and easy to make. 

### Dairy-Free Banana Ice Cream

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 ripe bananas
- 1 tablespoon almond milk (or any dairy-free milk of your choice)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- A pinch of sea salt (to enhance the sweetness)
- Optional toppings: chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, or fresh fruit

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Bananas:** Start by peeling the ripe bananas. It's best to use bananas that are spotty and brown for maximum sweetness and creaminess.

2. **Slice the Bananas:** Chop the bananas into small pieces, about 1-inch thick. This will help them freeze and blend more easily.

3. **Freeze the Bananas:** Place the banana slices in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Freeze them for at least 2-3 hours, or until completely frozen. This step is crucial for achieving that creamy ice cream texture.

4. **Blend the Frozen Bananas:** Once the banana slices are frozen, transfer them to a food processor. Add the tablespoon of almond milk, vanilla extract (if using), and a pinch of sea salt. 

5. **Process Until Creamy:** Blend on high speed. Initially, it might look crumbly, but be patient! Scrape down the sides as needed. Continue blending until you have a smooth, creamy texture, resembling soft-serve ice cream.

6. **Taste and Adjust:** Give it a taste. If you like it sweeter, you can add a drizzle of maple syrup or another sweetener to your liking and blend again.

7. **Serve Immediately:** For soft-serve style ice cream, scoop it into bowls right away and enjoy! If you prefer a firmer texture, transfer it to an airtight container and freeze for an additional 30-60 minutes before serving.

8. **Add Toppings:** Get creative with toppings! You can sprinkle some chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, or fresh fruit on top to add some extra flavor and texture.

### Enjoy!
This Dairy-Free Banana Ice Cream is a healthy and satisfying alternative to traditional ice cream. It’s packed with natural sweetness and is entirely plant-based, making it perfect for your dairy-free needs. Enjoy your treat!

Query: I want something light but filling
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: Here's a delightful recipe for **Lemon Herb Quinoa Salad** that’s light yet filling, perfect for a refreshing meal.

### Lemon Herb Quinoa Salad

#### Servings: 2

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water
- 1 lemon (juiced and zested)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes (halved)
- 1 cucumber (diced)
- 1/4 cup red onion (finely chopped)
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley (chopped)
- 1/4 cup feta cheese (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa:**
   Start by rinsing the quinoa under cold water in a fine mesh strainer. This helps remove the natural coating, called saponin, which can make it taste bitter.

2. **Cook the Quinoa:**
   In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of water. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa has absorbed all the water. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 minutes.

3. **Fluff the Quinoa:**
   After the quinoa has absorbed all the water, use a fork to fluff it. Set it aside to cool for a few minutes.

4. **Prepare the Dressing:**
   In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, salt, and black pepper until well combined. This will add a bright flavor to the salad.

5. **Combine the Ingredients:**
   In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and parsley. Pour the lemon dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine, making sure all the ingredients are coated evenly.

6. **Add Feta (if using):**
   If you like feta cheese, crumble it over the top of the salad and give it one last gentle toss.

7. **Serve:**
   Divide the salad into two bowls or plates. This dish can be served immediately, but it tastes even better if you let it sit for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Enjoy your light yet filling Lemon Herb Quinoa Salad!

Feel free to customize it by adding any other vegetables or proteins like grilled chicken or chickpeas for added nutrition!

Query: Kosher dessert for Passover
Dietary Restriction: kosher
Recipe Response: Here's a delightful recipe for Chocolate Coconut Macaroons, a classic kosher dessert that’s perfect for Passover. This recipe serves 2 people, so you can enjoy a sweet treat without too much leftover.

### Chocolate Coconut Macaroons:

#### Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups shredded unsweetened coconut
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup almond flour (or finely ground almonds)
- 2 large egg whites
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips or dairy-free chocolate chips for a vegan option

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 325°F (165°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the macaroons from sticking.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the shredded coconut, granulated sugar, and almond flour. Stir them together until well mixed. The almond flour adds a nice texture and flavor to the macaroons.

3. **Prepare Egg Whites**: In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until they become frothy. You want to achieve soft peaks; this helps give the macaroons their airy texture. 

4. **Combine Ingredients**: Gently fold the frothy egg whites into the coconut mixture. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites too much. Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, and gently combine everything until the mixture is moist but not soupy.

5. **Shape the Macaroons**: Using a tablespoon or a small ice cream scoop, drop the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. You can shape them into rounded mounds for a rustic look.

6. **Bake**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the macaroons are firm to the touch.

7. **Cool the Macaroons**: Once baked, remove the macaroons from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. 

8. **Melt the Chocolate**: While the macaroons are cooling, melt the chocolate chips. You can do this in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave, heating in 30-second intervals, stirring in between until smooth, or use a double boiler.

9. **Dip the Macaroons**: Once the macaroons are cool, dip the bottom half of each one into the melted chocolate, then place them back on the wire rack for the chocolate to set. Alternatively, you can drizzle the melted chocolate over the top of each macaroon for a more decorative touch.

10. **Serve**: Once the chocolate has set, your delicious Chocolate Coconut Macaroons are ready to serve. Enjoy them with a cup of tea or coffee!

These macaroons are not only easy to make but also incredibly satisfying. They’re sure to impress your guests during Passover!

Query: Kosher dessert for Passover
Dietary Restriction: kosher
Recipe Response: Here's a delightful recipe for **Flourless Chocolate Cake** that's perfect for Passover and is suitable for a Kosher diet. This rich and decadent dessert is sure to impress and serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 4 oz (113g) bittersweet chocolate (or semi-sweet, if preferred)
- 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup (60ml) unsalted butter (or margarine, for kosher)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup (20g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat Your Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a small round cake pan (about 6 inches) and line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Melt the Chocolate and Butter**: In a saucepan or a microwave-safe bowl, combine the bittersweet chocolate and unsalted butter. If using the stove, melt over low heat, stirring constantly until smooth. If using the microwave, heat in short intervals (15-30 seconds), stirring in between until melted. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.

3. **Whisk in Sugar and Eggs**: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, add the granulated sugar to the melted chocolate mixture and mix thoroughly. Then, crack the eggs into the bowl and add the vanilla extract. Whisk together until the mixture is smooth and shiny.

4. **Incorporate Dry Ingredients**: Sift the unsweetened cocoa powder and salt into the chocolate mixture. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients using a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if there are a few small lumps.

5. **Pour and Bake**: Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan, smoothing the top to ensure an even layer. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes. The cake is done when the top has set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

6. **Cool the Cake**: After baking, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edges to loosen it before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely.

7. **Serve**: Once cooled, you can dust the top lightly with powdered sugar or cocoa powder before slicing. This cake is delightful on its own or served with fresh berries or a dollop of whipped cream (or a non-dairy whipped topping for a Kosher option).

2. **Prep the Bell Peppers:**
   - While the quinoa is cooking, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

4. **Stuff the Peppers:**
   - Take the cooked quinoa mixture and spoon it into each bell pepper, filling them generously.
   - Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. If desired, sprinkle shredded cheese on top of each filled pepper for a delicious cheesy crust.

5. **Bake:**
   - Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
   - Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the peppers are tender and the tops are slightly golden.

Query: Vegan chocolate cake for my birthday but I'm also trying to avoid refined sugar
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for a **Vegan Chocolate Cake with Naturally Sweetened Frosting** that avoids refined sugar using ripe bananas and maple syrup. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Ingredients

#### For the Cake:
- 1 cup whole wheat flour (or any flour of your choice)
- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 ripe banana, mashed
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil)
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

#### For the Frosting:
- 1/4 cup coconut cream (chilled overnight)
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup (or to taste)
- 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder

### Instructions

#### Making the Cake:
1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a small cake pan (around 6 inches) with a little oil or line it with parchment paper.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, sift together the whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. This helps to aerate the flour and incorporate air, ensuring a light cake.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, combine the mashed banana, maple syrup, almond milk, vegetable oil, and apple cider vinegar. Whisk them together until smooth. The vinegar and baking soda will help the cake rise and create a fluffy texture.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined (do not over-mix; a few lumps are okay).

5. **Bake the Cake:** Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 

6. **Cool the Cake:** Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.

#### Making the Frosting:
7. **Prepare the Frosting:** While the cake is cooling, scoop the chilled coconut cream into a bowl. Whip it with a hand mixer (or whisk vigorously) until it’s light and fluffy. 

8. **Sweeten the Frosting:** Add maple syrup and cocoa powder to the whipped coconut cream. Mix until fully combined. Taste and adjust the sweetness or cocoa to your preference.

#### Assemble the Cake:
9. **Frost the Cake:** Once the cake is completely cool, spread the vegan chocolate frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake using a spatula.

10. **Serve:** Slice the cake into 2 pieces and enjoy your delicious, refined-sugar-free, vegan chocolate cake on your special day!

This cake is rich, moist, and perfect for celebrating your birthday! Enjoy every bite!

Query: Something that feels indulgent but isn't terrible for me
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Here’s a recipe for **Herb-Crusted Baked Salmon**. It’s indulgent in flavor while being healthy and packed with nutrients. This dish serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 salmon fillets (about 6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 cup fresh breadcrumbs (or panko)
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, finely chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried dill)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). This allows for even cooking and a nice crust on the salmon.

2. **Prepare the baking dish:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.

3. **Make the herb crust:** In a medium bowl, combine the fresh breadcrumbs, chopped parsley, dill, and olive oil. Mix well until the breadcrumbs are slightly moistened and all herbs are evenly distributed. Add a pinch of salt and pepper for seasoning.

4. **Prepare the salmon:** Place the salmon fillets skin-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Pat them dry with a paper towel to ensure a good sear. Brush the top of each fillet generously with Dijon mustard, ensuring a nice even layer.

5. **Apply the herb crust:** Press the breadcrumb mixture firmly onto the mustard-coated sides of the salmon fillets. Make sure to cover the surface well to form a tasty crust as it bakes.

6. **Bake the salmon:** Place the baking sheet in your preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. The breadcrumbs should be golden brown and crisp.

7. **Serve:** Remove from the oven and let sit for a minute. Serve the herb-crusted salmon with lemon wedges on the side for an added burst of flavor.

Query: I'm pescatarian but I hate fish. Can you give me a seafood pasta recipe?
Dietary Restriction: pescatarian
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here's a delicious Shrimp and Spinach Pasta recipe that is perfect for pescatarians who may not enjoy fish. This dish is flavorful, easy to prepare, and serves 2 people.

### Shrimp and Spinach Pasta

#### Ingredients:
- 8 ounces of pasta (like fettuccine or linguine)
- 8 ounces of shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 cups of fresh spinach
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup of heavy cream
- 2 tablespoons of olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (optional, adjust for spice preference)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving
- Fresh lemon juice, for drizzling
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

#### Instructions:

1. **Cook the Pasta:**
   - In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta and set it aside.

2. **Sauté the Shrimp:**
   - While the pasta is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
   - Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes, and sauté for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant.
   - Add the shrimp to the skillet, seasoning with salt and pepper. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the shrimp turns pink and is cooked through. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set aside.

3. **Make the Cream Sauce:**
   - In the same skillet, add the heavy cream and bring it to a gentle simmer, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom. Allow it to cook for about 2 minutes until slightly thickened.
   - Add the fresh spinach and cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes until it wilts.

4. **Combine Pasta and Shrimp:**
   - Return the cooked shrimp to the skillet with the cream and spinach. Then add the drained pasta into the skillet.
   - Toss everything together, and add reserved pasta cooking water a little at a time until the sauce reaches your desired consistency. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.

5. **Serve:**
   - Plate the pasta and finish with a drizzle of fresh lemon juice, a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese, and chopped parsley for garnish.

Query: I'm dairy-free but pregnant and craving ice cream constantly
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for **Coconut Milk Ice Cream** that’s dairy-free and perfect for satisfying your ice cream cravings during pregnancy! This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
- 1 can (13.5 oz) full-fat coconut milk
- 1/4 cup pure maple syrup (or to taste)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of sea salt
- Optional mix-ins: dairy-free chocolate chips, fruit puree, or nuts

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare Your Ingredients**: Start by gathering all your ingredients. Open the can of coconut milk and give it a good stir. You can use an electric mixer or a whisk to combine things smoothly if you prefer.

2. **Mix the Base**: In a mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and a pinch of sea salt. Whisk together until well combined and smooth. Taste the mixture and adjust the sweetness with more maple syrup if desired.

3. **Add Mix-Ins**: If you'd like to include any mix-ins, such as dairy-free chocolate chips, fruit puree (like mashed bananas or strawberry puree), or nuts, now is the time to add them to the mixture. Stir gently to distribute evenly.

4. **Chill the Mixture**: Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and cover it. Place it in the refrigerator for about 1 hour to chill. This step helps improve the final texture.

5. **Churn the Ice Cream**: If you have an ice cream maker, pour the chilled coconut mixture into the ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions (typically about 20-25 minutes). If you don’t have an ice cream maker, you can still make it by freezing it in a shallow dish.

6. **Freeze for Texture**: Once churned, transfer the ice cream into an airtight container. If using the shallow dish method, simply pour in the mixture and freeze it. Allow it to freeze for at least 4 hours until it becomes firm. If you're using the shallow dish method, remember to stir the mixture every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours to break up ice crystals and ensure creamy texture.

7. **Serve and Enjoy**: When you're ready to enjoy, scoop out your delicious coconut milk ice cream into bowls. You can top it with some fresh fruit or a drizzle of dairy-free chocolate sauce if you like!

### Tips:
- Store any leftovers in the freezer, but remember to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften before scooping the next time.
- Feel free to experiment with different flavors by adding almond extract, coffee, or cocoa powder for a different twist!

This coconut milk ice cream is creamy, delicious, and absolutely satisfying for your cravings. Enjoy every bite!

Query: Gluten-free pizza dough that actually tastes good and isn't cardboard
Dietary Restriction: gluten-free
Recipe Response: ### Delicious Gluten-Free Pizza Dough

**Servings:** 2 (makes one medium pizza)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional for flavor)
- 1/2 cup warm water (about 110°F/43°C)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and place a pizza stone or an upside-down baking sheet inside to warm up.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder. Whisk together until evenly mixed. This will be the basis of your dough and gives it flavor.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, combine the warm water, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar. Stir until mixed.

4. **Form the Dough**: Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon until a dough starts to form. You might find it easier to use your hands to knead the dough gently for about 1-2 minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky but still manageable. If it’s too wet, add a little more flour, a tablespoon at a time.

5. **Shape the Dough**: Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper. Sprinkle a little gluten-free flour on top to prevent sticking. With your hands, gently press the dough into a circle about 10-12 inches in diameter, creating a slight raise at the edges for the crust.

6. **Pre-bake the Crust**: Transfer the parchment paper with the dough onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, just until the edges start to lightly brown and firm up.

7. **Add Toppings**: Remove the pre-baked crust from the oven. Add your favorite pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings of choice. Go for the classics like pepperoni, bell peppers, or mushrooms, or get creative with fresh basil and mozzarella.

8. **Final Bake**: Return the topped pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges of the crust are golden brown.

9. **Cool and Serve**: Once done, carefully remove the pizza from the oven. Let it cool for a couple of minutes, then slice it up and enjoy your delicious homemade gluten-free pizza!

  - 2 medium zucchinis
  - Salt to taste 

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Zucchini Noodles:**
   - Use a spiralizer or a vegetable peeler to create zucchini noodles. Set aside. If you don’t have a spiralizer, peel the zucchini into long strips. Sprinkle with a little salt to help draw out excess moisture.

2. **Make the Meatballs:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, almond flour, chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). 
   - Form the mixture into balls, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
   - Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until they are cooked through and browned on the outside.

3. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - While the meatballs are baking, heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds, being careful not to burn it.
   - Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried basil, and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Cook the Zucchini Noodles:**
   - In a large skillet, heat a small amount of olive oil over medium heat. Add the zucchini noodles and cook for about 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are just tender but still al dente. Do not overcook, as they can become mushy. 

5. **Combine and Serve:**
   - Once the meatballs are done baking, add them to the saucepan with the marinara sauce, gently stirring to coat each meatball.
   - Divide the zucchini noodles between two plates and top with the meatballs and sauce mixture.
   - Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, and enjoy your healthy and delicious Paleo spaghetti and meatballs!

Recipe Response: **Recipe: Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies**

**Serving Size:** 2 people (approximately 6 cookies)

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (melted)
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup honey or pure maple syrup (if non-diabetic)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (at least 70% cocoa)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cookies from sticking.

2. **Mix Wet Ingredients:** In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Stir them together until you have a smooth mixture. Then, crack in the egg and whisk it in thoroughly until the mixture is well combined and slightly frothy.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, mix the almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Make sure to break up any clumps in the almond flour for an even texture.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until everything is combined into a thick dough. To ensure a smooth consistency, avoid over-mixing.

5. **Add Chocolate Chips:** Fold in the dark chocolate chips using a spatula or spoon, making sure they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

6. **Shape the Cookies:** Using tablespoon-sized portions of dough, scoop and roll them into balls. Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between each one as they will spread slightly during baking.

7. **Flatten Cookies:** Gently press down on each dough ball with the back of a spoon to flatten them slightly. This ensures more even baking.

8. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes until the edges are golden brown. The cookies will appear soft; they will firm up as they cool.

9. **Cool Down:** Once done, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. **Serve:** Enjoy your delicious almond flour chocolate chip cookies while they're fresh, or store any leftovers in an airtight container for a tasty treat later!

These cookies are not only diabetic-friendly but also gluten-free and made with nutritious ingredients. Enjoy!

Dietary Restriction: keto
Recipe Response: **Keto Lemon Garlic Butter Shrimp**

This delightful dish offers a fresh, tangy flavor with the richness of butter, keeping it satisfying without the heaviness. It serves 2 people and is perfect for a light yet filling keto meal.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined (fresh or frozen)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 lemon (juice and zest)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Optional: 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes for a bit of heat

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Shrimp:** If your shrimp are frozen, thaw them by placing them in a bowl of cold water for about 15 minutes. Once thawed, ensure they are fully peeled and deveined. Pat them dry lightly with a paper towel and set aside.

2. **Melt the Butter:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat until melted and foamy.

3. **Sauté Garlic:** Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic as it can turn bitter.

4. **Cook the Shrimp:** Increase the heat to medium-high, then add the shrimp to the skillet in a single layer. Season them with salt, black pepper, and if using, the red pepper flakes. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the shrimp turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook them.

5. **Add Lemon Flavor:** Once the shrimp are cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Then, pour in the juice of the lemon and add the lemon zest. Stir gently to coat the shrimp in the lemon garlic butter sauce, allowing the flavors to meld for about 1 minute.

6. **Garnish and Serve:** Remove the skillet from the heat and sprinkle the chopped parsley over the top. Give it a gentle stir to combine. Serve the shrimp warm, alongside a fresh green salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.

Query: I want to make a birthday cake but I'm diabetic. Something that still tastes good?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious and diabetic-friendly recipe for a **Almond Flour Chocolate Cake** that is not only lower in carbs but still packs a rich chocolate flavor. 

### Almond Flour Chocolate Cake (Serves 2)

#### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup sugar substitute (like erythritol or stevia, adjust according to sweetness preference)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- Optional: 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (sugar-free if available)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined. This ensures that your leavening agent is evenly distributed throughout the flour.

3. **Prepare the Wet Ingredients**: In another large mixing bowl, beat the eggs until fluffy. Then, add your sugar substitute, vanilla extract, and unsweetened applesauce. Mix thoroughly until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.

4. **Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients**: Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring gently until just combined. If you're using sugar-free dark chocolate chips, fold them in at this point for an extra chocolatey touch.

5. **Pour into Pan**: Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan, smoothing the top with a spatula to ensure even cooking.

6. **Bake the Cake**: Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake, as almond flour cakes can dry out quickly.

7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. **Serve**: Once the cake has cooled, slice it and serve as is, or enjoy it with a dollop of sugar-free whipped cream or fresh berries if desired.

### Tips:
- Remember to taste the batter for sweetness before baking, since sugar substitutes can vary in sweetness.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

This cake is rich, moist, and satisfying without the sugar spike, making it perfect for a birthday celebration! Enjoy!

Something that still tastes good?,8,True,diabetic-friendly,"Here's a delicious and diabetic-friendly recipe for a **Almond Flour Chocolate Cake** that is not only lower in carbs but still packs a rich chocolate flavor. 

### Almond Flour Chocolate Cake (Serves 2)

#### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup sugar substitute (like erythritol or stevia, adjust according to sweetness preference)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- Optional: 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (sugar-free if available)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined. This ensures that your leavening agent is evenly distributed throughout the flour.

3. **Prepare the Wet Ingredients**: In another large mixing bowl, beat the eggs until fluffy. Then, add your sugar substitute, vanilla extract, and unsweetened applesauce. Mix thoroughly until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.

4. **Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients**: Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring gently until just combined. If you're using sugar-free dark chocolate chips, fold them in at this point for an extra chocolatey touch.

5. **Pour into Pan**: Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan, smoothing the top with a spatula to ensure even cooking.

6. **Bake the Cake**: Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake, as almond flour cakes can dry out quickly.

7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. **Serve**: Once the cake has cooled, slice it and serve as is, or enjoy it with a dollop of sugar-free whipped cream or fresh berries if desired.

### Tips:
- Remember to taste the batter for sweetness before baking, since sugar substitutes can vary in sweetness.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

This cake is rich, moist, and satisfying without the sugar spike, making it perfect for a birthday celebration! Enjoy!",text/plain,I want to make a birthday cake but I'm diabetic. Something that still tastes good?

Query: Dairy-free but cheese is okay sometimes
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for **Creamy Spinach and Cheese Pasta** that balances dairy-free ingredients while allowing for cheese if you'd like a touch of creaminess. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 200g pasta (your choice)
- 2 cups fresh spinach (or frozen)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 cup vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup cashew cream (you can make it by blending soaked cashews with water)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Grated cheese (optional, for serving)
- Red pepper flakes (optional, for serving)

### Instructions:

1. **Cook the Pasta:** 
   In a pot, bring salted water to a rolling boil. Add your pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Once cooked, reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta water, then drain the rest and set the pasta aside.

2. **Sauté Garlic:**
   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant but not browned.

3. **Add Spinach:**
   Add the fresh spinach to the skillet with the garlic, and cook for 3-5 minutes until the spinach wilts. If using frozen spinach, ensure it’s thoroughly heated and any excess moisture evaporates.

4. **Create the Sauce:**
   Pour in the vegetable broth and bring to a simmer. After a minute, stir in the cashew cream, mixing it well into the spinach and garlic mixture. If the sauce seems too thick, add in a splash of the reserved pasta water until you reach the desired creaminess.

5. **Season:** 
   Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. If you want a little kick, add red pepper flakes to your liking.

6. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**
   Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing everything together to ensure the pasta is well coated with the sauce. If it looks too dry, add more reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until it is just right.

7. **Serve:**
   Divide the creamy spinach and cheese pasta between two plates. If you like, sprinkle some grated cheese on top for additional creaminess and flavor. You can also add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for an extra zing.

### Enjoy your Creamy Spinach and Cheese Pasta!

This dish is not only quick but satisfying, with the beautiful green of the spinach elevating it presentation-wise, and it can easily adapt to your dietary needs while still being flavorful.

Query: I want paleo bread but every recipe I've tried is terrible
Dietary Restriction: paleo
Recipe Response: Let’s make a delicious and simple Paleo Almond Flour Bread. This recipe yields about 2 servings.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsweetened apple cider vinegar
- 2 tbsp honey (optional for sweetness)
- 1 tbsp olive oil or melted coconut oil

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This is crucial for achieving a nice rise in your bread.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk them together until they are well incorporated. This dry mixture is the base of your bread and helps it rise.

3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, crack the three eggs and add the olive oil (or melted coconut oil), apple cider vinegar, and honey if you’re using it. Whisk these ingredients together until you achieve a smooth mixture.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures**: Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix well with a spatula until everything is well combined and forms a thick batter. The mixture will be somewhat dense.

5. **Form the Bread**: Line a small loaf pan (about 5x3 inches) with parchment paper for easy removal later. Transfer the batter into the pan, smoothing out the top with a spatula. Make sure to spread it evenly so it bakes uniformly.

6. **Bake**: Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes. The bread should turn a golden brown, and you can check for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center; it should come out clean.

7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 5-10 minutes. Then transfer it to a cooling rack to cool completely. Allowing it to cool helps in firming up the texture.

8. **Slice and Serve**: Once cooled, slice your bread into thick slices. It’s great toasted or topped with your favorite Paleo-friendly spreads, such as avocado, nut butter, or even homemade jam.

Enjoy your delicious and easy Paleo bread! This bread can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for several days or can be frozen for longer storage, making it a great staple to keep on hand.

Query: Halal BBQ recipe for summer
Dietary Restriction: halal
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious recipe for Halal BBQ Chicken Skewers, perfect for a summer gathering! This recipe serves 2 people.

### Halal BBQ Chicken Skewers

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (or a halal alternative)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- Salt to taste
- Wooden or metal skewers (if using wooden, soak them in water for 30 minutes)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, minced garlic, paprika, ground cumin, black pepper, and a pinch of salt. Whisk everything together until it's well-blended.

2. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   Cut the chicken breasts into approximately 1-inch cubes. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring that all pieces are well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. If you have more time, marinating for a few hours or overnight enhances the flavor.

3. **Preheat the Grill:**
   Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If you are using a charcoal grill, let the coals burn until they are covered with white ash. For a gas grill, preheating for about 10-15 minutes should suffice.

4. **Skewer the Chicken:**
   Once the chicken is marinated, take the skewers and thread the chicken pieces onto them, leaving a little space between each piece for even cooking. If you like, you can also add bell peppers, onions, or cherry tomatoes to the skewers for extra flavor and color.

5. **Grill the Skewers:**
   Place the skewers on the preheated grill. Cook for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is fully cooked and has nice grill marks. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).

6. **Serve and Enjoy:**
   Once done, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a couple of minutes. Serve the BBQ chicken skewers with a side of fresh salad, rice, or flatbreads. You may also drizzle some extra lemon juice over the skewers for added brightness.

### Tip:
Feel free to customize your skewers with different vegetables or spices based on your preference. Enjoy your delicious Halal BBQ Chicken Skewers on a sunny day!

Query: Paleo spaghetti and meatballs
Dietary Restriction: paleo
Recipe Response: **Paleo Spaghetti and Meatballs**

This delicious recipe serves 2 people and offers a healthier twist on a classic dish. Instead of traditional pasta, we’ll use spiralized zucchini, also known as ""zoodles,"" paired with flavorful meatballs made from lean ground meat.

### Ingredients:
#### For the Meatballs:
- 1 pound ground beef or turkey
- 1/4 cup almond flour
- 1 large egg
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (oregano, basil, and thyme blend)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Olive oil, for cooking

#### For the Sauce:
- 1 can (15 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and pepper, to taste

#### For the Zoodles:
- 2 medium zucchinis

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Meatballs
1. **Preheat your oven** to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef or turkey, almond flour, egg, minced garlic, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix until all ingredients are just combined; be careful not to overmix.
3. Form the mixture into small meatballs, about 1- to 1.5-inch in diameter, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

#### Step 2: Bake the Meatballs
4. Once your oven is preheated, place the meatballs in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they are cooked through and golden brown. You can also use a skillet to brown them on the stovetop, cooking for about 4-5 minutes per side instead of baking.

#### Step 3: Make the Sauce
5. While the meatballs bake, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. 
6. Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
7. Let the sauce simmer gently for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally to keep it from sticking.

#### Step 4: Prepare the Zoodles
8. While the sauce is simmering, wash and dry the zucchinis. Use a spiralizer to create zucchini noodles. If you don’t have a spiralizer, you can use a vegetable peeler to create thin slices.
9. Once spiralized, lightly salt the zoodles and let them sit for about 5 minutes. This helps draw out excess moisture. After resting, gently pat them dry with a paper towel.

#### Step 5: Serve the Dish
10. In a skillet over medium heat, lightly sauté the zoodles for 2-3 minutes until they are tender but still slightly crisp. Be careful not to overcook them, as they can become mushy.
11. To serve, place the zoodles on plates and top with the meatballs and generous spoonfuls of tomato sauce.
12. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired, and enjoy your healthy, Paleo spaghetti and meatballs!

This dish is not only satisfying but also versatile, allowing you to swap different meats or herbs according to your preference. Enjoy your meal!

This delicious recipe serves 2 people and offers a healthier twist on a classic dish. Instead of traditional pasta, we’ll use spiralized zucchini, also known as ""zoodles,"" paired with flavorful meatballs made from lean ground meat.

### Ingredients:
#### For the Meatballs:
- 1 pound ground beef or turkey
- 1/4 cup almond flour
- 1 large egg
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (oregano, basil, and thyme blend)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Olive oil, for cooking

#### For the Sauce:
- 1 can (15 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and pepper, to taste

#### For the Zoodles:
- 2 medium zucchinis

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Meatballs
1. **Preheat your oven** to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef or turkey, almond flour, egg, minced garlic, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix until all ingredients are just combined; be careful not to overmix.
3. Form the mixture into small meatballs, about 1- to 1.5-inch in diameter, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

#### Step 2: Bake the Meatballs
4. Once your oven is preheated, place the meatballs in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they are cooked through and golden brown. You can also use a skillet to brown them on the stovetop, cooking for about 4-5 minutes per side instead of baking.

#### Step 3: Make the Sauce
5. While the meatballs bake, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. 
6. Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
7. Let the sauce simmer gently for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally to keep it from sticking.

#### Step 4: Prepare the Zoodles
8. While the sauce is simmering, wash and dry the zucchinis. Use a spiralizer to create zucchini noodles. If you don’t have a spiralizer, you can use a vegetable peeler to create thin slices.
9. Once spiralized, lightly salt the zoodles and let them sit for about 5 minutes. This helps draw out excess moisture. After resting, gently pat them dry with a paper towel.

#### Step 5: Serve the Dish
10. In a skillet over medium heat, lightly sauté the zoodles for 2-3 minutes until they are tender but still slightly crisp. Be careful not to overcook them, as they can become mushy.
11. To serve, place the zoodles on plates and top with the meatballs and generous spoonfuls of tomato sauce.
12. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired, and enjoy your healthy, Paleo spaghetti and meatballs!

This dish is not only satisfying but also versatile, allowing you to swap different meats or herbs according to your preference. Enjoy your meal!",text/plain,Paleo spaghetti and meatballs

3. **Prepare the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooking, prepare your vegetables. In a large bowl, add the halved cherry tomatoes, diced cucumber, diced bell pepper, chopped red onion, and parsley.

4. **Dress the Salad**: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to make the dressing. Pour this dressing over the vegetable mixture and toss to combine.

5. **Combine Quinoa and Vegetables**: Once the quinoa has cooled slightly, add it to the bowl with the vegetables and dressing. Gently stir everything together until well mixed.

6. **Taste and Adjust**: Taste your salad and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, or lemon juice as desired.

7. **Serve**: Divide the quinoa salad into bowls and serve. It's great either warm or chilled.

Query: Raw vegan soup that's actually warm somehow?
Dietary Restriction: raw vegan
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here’s a delicious recipe for a **Warm Raw Vegan Tomato Basil Soup** that provides a comforting bowl of goodness without any cooking. This recipe serves 2.

### Warm Raw Vegan Tomato Basil Soup

#### Ingredients:

- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tablespoon raw olive oil
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- Salt to taste
- Pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon nutritional yeast (optional for a cheesy flavor)
- Water, as needed to adjust consistency

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Ingredients**: 
   - Start by rinsing the tomatoes, carrot, and cucumber under cool water to remove any dirt. Roughly chop the tomatoes and cucumber. Peel and chop the carrot into smaller chunks for easier blending.

Query: I'm trying to eat clean but I want pizza
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious and healthy recipe for **Cauliflower Crust Pizza** that allows you to enjoy pizza while keeping it clean and nutritious. This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
- 1 medium head cauliflower, riced (about 2 to 3 cups)
- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (part-skim for a healthier option)
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Fresh basil or spinach (optional for topping)
- Tomato sauce (preferably no added sugar) 
- Additional toppings of your choice (like bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms)

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent sticking.

2. **Rice the Cauliflower**: Remove the leaves and stem from the cauliflower. Cut it into florets and then pulse in a food processor until it resembles rice or fine crumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a box grater.

3. **Cook the Cauliflower**: Place the riced cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for about 4-5 minutes until tender. Let it cool for a few minutes. Once it’s cool enough to handle, use a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth to squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial for a crispy crust!

4. **Make the Crust Mixture**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the riced cauliflower, shredded mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, egg, garlic powder, dried oregano, and salt. Mix until fully combined. The mixture should be somewhat sticky and hold together.

5. **Form the Crust**: Transfer the cauliflower mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Using your hands or a spatula, spread the mixture into a round pizza shape about 1/4 inch thick.

6. **Bake the Crust**: Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden brown and the crust is firm.

7. **Add Sauce and Toppings**: Remove the crust from the oven and spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the top. Add your choice of toppings and sprinkle more mozzarella cheese on top if desired.

8. **Final Bake**: Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

9. **Serve**: Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil or spinach if you like.

Query: Something keto-ish but not super strict
Dietary Restriction: keto
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious recipe for **Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken**. This dish is flavorful and satisfying, while keeping with a low-carb mindset. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (optional)
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken:** Season both sides of the chicken breasts generously with salt and pepper.

2. **Sear the Chicken:** In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the skillet. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through (the internal temperature should reach 165°F). Once done, remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside on a plate.

3. **Make the Sauce:** In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium, and add the minced garlic. Sauté the garlic for about 30 seconds, or until it's fragrant; be careful not to let it brown.

4. **Add Cream and Cheese:** Pour in the heavy cream, stirring to combine with the garlic. Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese, mixing until smooth. If using, stir in the Italian seasoning. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 2-3 minutes until it slightly thickens.

5. **Combine Chicken and Sauce:** Return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet, spooning the creamy sauce over them. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for another 2-3 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the chicken to reheat.

6. **Serve:** Plate the chicken, drizzling extra sauce over the top. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and flavor. 

### Enjoy!
Serve your creamy garlic Parmesan chicken with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh salad for a complete meal.

Query: Diabetic-friendly dessert that doesn't use artificial sweeteners
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: ### Diabetic-Friendly Berry Chia Pudding

#### Servings: 2

This delicious and nutritious berry chia pudding is packed with fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants, making it an excellent choice for a diabetic-friendly dessert.

#### Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup chia seeds
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any other plant-based milk)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup mixed fresh berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
- A handful of chopped nuts (such as almonds or walnuts) for topping (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Mix the Base:** In a medium-sized bowl or jar, combine the chia seeds, unsweetened almond milk, and vanilla extract. Whisk together until well mixed. The chia seeds will start to absorb the liquid and swell.

3. **Refrigerate:** Cover the bowl or jar with a lid or plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight if possible. This allows the chia seeds to gel and create a pudding-like consistency.

4. **Prepare the Berries:** Just before serving, wash and gently pat dry the mixed fresh berries. You can slice larger berries (like strawberries) if you like.

5. **Assemble the Pudding:** Once the chia pudding has set and thickened, remove it from the refrigerator. Give it a good stir to ensure even consistency. Spoon the pudding into serving bowls.

6. **Top with Berries:** Layer the fresh berries generously on top of the chia pudding. If desired, sprinkle with a handful of chopped nuts for added crunch and nutrition.

7. **Serve and Enjoy:** Serve immediately, savoring the creamy texture of the chia pudding combined with the fresh fruits.

This delightful berry chia pudding not only satisfies your sweet tooth but also keeps your blood sugar in check. Enjoy your healthy treat!

Query: I don't like vegetables but I want to eat healthy
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for you that’s not vegetable-heavy but still healthy: **Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken**. This dish is packed with flavor and is a great source of protein. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: Fresh herbs for garnish (like parsley or basil)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade**: In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Whisk until well combined. This marinade will impart great flavor while keeping the chicken moist.

2. **Marinate the Chicken**: Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring all sides are coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. For even better flavor, marinate for up to 2 hours.

3. **Preheat the Grill**: If you're using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat (about 375°F to 400°F). If using a grill pan on the stove, heat it over medium heat and lightly oil it to prevent sticking.

4. **Grill the Chicken**: Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off. Place the chicken breasts on the grill or grill pan. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side, or until you see nice grill marks.

5. **Flip and Finish Cooking**: Flip the chicken breasts and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). The chicken should be golden brown with a juicy center.

6. **Rest the Chicken**: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest on a plate for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender.

7. **Serve**: Slice the grilled chicken and serve it with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and garnish with fresh herbs if desired. You could pair this with a simple side like brown rice or quinoa for a complete meal.

Query: I'm diabetic but I want to make a fruit cake for Christmas. My grandmother's recipe has tons of sugar and dried fruit but it's tradition and I can't just skip it this year. Is there any way to modify it so I can still participate in the family tradition without spiking my blood sugar?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Absolutely! You can make a delicious diabetic-friendly fruit cake that maintains the essence of traditional flavors while being mindful of sugar content. Here’s a modified recipe for a Diabetic-Friendly Fruit Cake that serves 2 people.

### Diabetic-Friendly Fruit Cake

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup mixed dried fruit (look for unsweetened varieties like raisins, cranberries, or apricots)
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce (this will help add moisture and sweetness)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup chopped nuts (such as walnuts or almonds, optional)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of nutmeg (optional)
- Zest of 1 orange (for added flavor)
- 3 tablespoons sugar substitute (like stevia or erythritol, adjust to taste)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Fruit**: In a bowl, soak the mixed dried fruit in warm water for about 10-15 minutes. This helps soften the fruit and brings out its natural sweetness. After soaking, drain it and set aside.

2. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Prepare a small loaf pan (around 5x7 inches) by greasing it lightly or lining it with parchment paper.

3. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, ground cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg (if using). This ensures that the baking soda and spices are evenly distributed.

4. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, mix the unsweetened applesauce, eggs, vanilla extract, and orange zest until well combined. You want the mixture to be smooth and thoroughly blended.

5. **Combine Dry and Wet Mixtures**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Do not overmix! Fold in the soaked dried fruit and nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the batter.

6. **Bake the Cake**: Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The edges may be golden brown.

7. **Cool and Serve**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. 

8. **Enjoy!**: Slice the cake once it's completely cool. It can be served plain, or you can enjoy it with a little cream cheese spread for added indulgence.

#### Storage:
Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

This fruit cake allows you to keep the tradition alive without compromising your health. Enjoy making it and being part of the family celebrations!

Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious Whole30-compliant recipe for **Creamy Coconut Chicken Curry** that serves 2 people. It's rich, satisfying, and full of flavor, perfect for those comfort food cravings while staying within your dietary guidelines.

### Creamy Coconut Chicken Curry

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil (or olive oil)
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger, grated or minced
- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk (full fat for creaminess)
- 1 tablespoon red curry paste (make sure it’s Whole30 compliant)
- 1 cup fresh spinach (or kale)
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional)
- Juice of 1 lime (optional)
  
#### Instructions:

1. **Heat the Oil**: In a medium-sized skillet, place the coconut oil over medium heat. Allow it to melt and warm up, ensuring it's evenly coated in the pan.

2. **Sauté Aromatics**: Add the chopped onion to the skillet and sauté for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onions become translucent. Stir regularly to prevent burning. Then add the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another 1 minute until fragrant.

3. **Cook the Chicken**: Toss in the chicken pieces, stirring to coat them with the aromatic mixture. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink on the outside, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking.

4. **Add the Curry Paste**: Stir in the red curry paste, allowing it to blend with the chicken and onion mixture. Cook for an additional minute to develop the flavors.

5. **Incorporate Coconut Milk**: Pour in the coconut milk, stirring to combine all ingredients thoroughly. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then lower the heat slightly. If you’re using fish sauce, add it now for extra umami.

6. **Add Vegetables**: Once the curry is simmering, add the sliced red bell pepper and spinach. Cook for another 3-5 minutes, allowing the peppers to soften and the spinach to wilt into the sauce. 

7. **Adjust Seasoning**: Taste the curry and season with salt and pepper to your liking. If you prefer a bit of acidity, squeeze in lime juice for brightness.

8. **Serve**: Remove from heat and garnish with fresh cilantro if desired. Serve hot over a bed of riced cauliflower or enjoy it on its own.

### Enjoy!
This Creamy Coconut Chicken Curry is not only comforting but also adheres to your Whole30 guidelines, making it a delightful meal that you can feel good about. Enjoy!

Query: I don't like vegetables but I want to eat healthy
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I understand! Let’s prepare a flavorful and healthy Chicken and Quinoa Bowl that hides some nutrition while being delicious. This recipe serves 2.

### Chicken and Quinoa Bowl Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth (or water)
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for extra flavor)
- Fresh herbs (like parsley or cilantro) for garnish (optional)
- Lemon wedges for serving

#### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Start by rinsing the quinoa under cool running water in a fine mesh strainer. This helps remove any bitterness. Drain well.

2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and chicken broth (or water). Bring it to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the heat and let it stand, covered, for another 5 minutes. Fluff it with a fork when done.

3. **Prepare the Chicken**: While the quinoa is cooking, take the chicken breasts and pat them dry with a paper towel. This helps them sear nicely. Season both sides of the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and pepper.

4. **Cook the Chicken**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the seasoned chicken breasts. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has a golden-brown crust. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C). Once done, remove them from the skillet and let them rest for a couple of minutes.

5. **Assemble the Bowl**: Slice the chicken into thin strips. In a serving bowl, place a generous amount of the cooked quinoa as the base. Arrange the sliced chicken on top.

6. **Optional Garnishes**: If you have fresh herbs, sprinkle them over the chicken and quinoa for a burst of freshness. Serve with lemon wedges on the side for a zesty kick—just squeeze some lemon juice over the top before enjoying!

### Enjoy!
This Chicken and Quinoa Bowl is not only satisfying but also packed with protein and fiber, promoting a healthy meal without heavy reliance on vegetables. Enjoy your delicious, nutritious dish!

Query: Whole30 compliant dinner that my non-Whole30 husband will actually eat
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious Whole30 compliant recipe that even your husband will enjoy: **Garlic Herb Chicken with Roasted Vegetables**. This dish is full of flavor and satisfying, making it perfect for both Whole30 adherents and those who aren’t. This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
**For the Chicken:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Juice of 1 lemon

**For the Roasted Vegetables:**
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 cup carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1 bell pepper, cut into bite-sized pieces (any color)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken Marinade:**
   - In a medium bowl, combine the minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, rosemary, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. This will create a fragrant marinade for the chicken.

2. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - Place the chicken breasts in the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Allow them to marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours if you have the time) in the refrigerator to absorb the flavors.

3. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This temperature will help achieve a nice roast on the vegetables while cooking the chicken perfectly.

4. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - On a large baking sheet, toss the broccoli, carrots, and bell pepper with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Make sure the vegetables are evenly coated. Spread them out in a single layer for even roasting.

5. **Roasting the Vegetables:**
   - Place the baking sheet with the vegetables in the preheated oven. Roast them for about 20 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly caramelized.

6. **Cook the Chicken:**
   - While the vegetables are roasting, heat a skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add a little olive oil if the pan isn’t non-stick.
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess drip off, and carefully place it in the hot skillet. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side until golden brown, then flip the chicken and reduce the heat to medium. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). Remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.

7. **Serve:**
   - Divide the roasted vegetables between two plates and top with sliced garlic herb chicken. Optionally, drizzle with a little more lemon juice or garnish with fresh herbs if desired.

Enjoy this wonderfully balanced and flavorful dinner that satisfies both Whole30 standards and the taste buds of a non-Whole30 eater!

Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for a **Vegetarian Coconut Chickpea Curry** that is both flavorful and free of onions and garlic. This dish serves 2 people and is perfect for a cozy meal. 

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup canned chickpeas (rinsed and drained)
- 1 can (14 oz) coconut milk
- 1 medium carrot, diced
- 1 bell pepper (any color), diced
- 1 medium potato, diced
- 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated (or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger)
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil or coconut oil
- Fresh cilantro (for garnish)
- Cooked rice or quinoa (for serving)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the vegetables:** Start by washing and chopping the carrot, bell pepper, and potato into small, bite-sized pieces. This will ensure they cook evenly.

2. **Heat the oil:** In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. If you're using coconut oil, it may take a bit longer to melt.

3. **Add ginger:** Once the oil is hot, add the grated ginger. Sauté it for about 30 seconds until it's fragrant, making sure not to let it brown.

4. **Cook the vegetables:** Add the diced carrot and potato to the pan. Stir well to coat them in the oil, then cover the saucepan and allow them to cook for about 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften.

5. **Add bell pepper and spices:** Next, add the diced bell pepper, curry powder, turmeric powder, and cumin powder. Stir everything together to mix the spices evenly with the vegetables. Cook for another 2 minutes to let the spices become aromatic.

6. **Add chickpeas and coconut milk:** Pour in the drained chickpeas and the can of coconut milk. Stir well to combine everything. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.

7. **Simmer the curry:** Reduce the heat to low and let the curry simmer uncovered for about 15-20 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the vegetables to cook through. Stir occasionally, and if you notice the curry is getting too thick, you can add a splash of water to reach your desired consistency.

8. **Season the curry:** After simmering, season the curry with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the spices to your liking if needed.

9. **Serve:** Once everything is cooked and the flavors have developed, remove the curry from the heat. Serve it hot over cooked rice or quinoa. Garnish with fresh cilantro for a vibrant touch.

### Creamy Cashew Cheese Spread

**Serving Size:** 2 people

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup raw cashews (soaked for 2-4 hours)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice (freshly squeezed for best flavor)
- 1 clove garlic (minced)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/4 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (adds tang)
- 1 teaspoon dried herbs (such as oregano or thyme, optional)
- Water (as needed for consistency)

**Instructions:**

1. **Soak the Cashews:** Place the raw cashews in a bowl and cover them with water. Allow them to soak for 2-4 hours to soften. Once soaked, drain and rinse them under cold running water.

2. **Blend the Ingredients:** In a food processor or a high-speed blender, combine the soaked cashews, lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, salt, black pepper, and apple cider vinegar. If you're using herbs, add them in as well.

3. **Add Water:** Blend the mixture until it starts to combine. Depending on your desired consistency, add water a tablespoon at a time. Continue blending until the cheese is creamy and smooth. Scrape down the sides of the processor or blender as needed to make sure everything is mixed well.

4. **Taste and Adjust:** Once blended, taste the cheese spread and adjust seasoning as necessary. You can add more salt, lemon juice for tanginess, or herbs for extra flavor.

5. **Serve:** Transfer the cheese spread into a small bowl or airtight container. Allow it to chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes to firm up a bit and enhance the flavors. Serve with crackers, fresh veggies, or spread on your favorite bread.

6. **Storage:** Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. 

Enjoy your homemade creamy cashew cheese spread! It's not only tasty, but it also brings a delightful creaminess to a variety of dishes!
