- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tbsp unsweetened applesauce
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any milk alternative)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a small round cake pan (about 6 inches) or line it with parchment paper.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, erythritol, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Stir these dry ingredients until they are well mixed.

Query: I'm mostly vegetarian but I eat fish sometimes
Dietary Restriction: pescatarian
Recipe Response: Great! I have the perfect recipe for you: **Lemon Herb Grilled Salmon with Quinoa Salad**. This dish is flavorful, healthy, and very satisfying. 

### Serving Size:
2 people

### Ingredients:
For the salmon:
- 2 salmon fillets (about 6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 lemon (zest and juice)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the quinoa salad:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups vegetable broth or water
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 1 bell pepper (any color), diced
- ¼ red onion, finely chopped
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Quinoa Salad
1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Place the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water for about 1 minute. This helps remove its natural bitterness.
   
2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and vegetable broth (or water). Bring it to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for another 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.

3. **Mix the Salad**: In a large bowl, combine the fluffed quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, and parsley.

4. **Dress the Salad**: In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Pour this dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine. Set aside to let the flavors meld.

#### Step 2: Prepare the Salmon
1. **Marinate the Salmon**: In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them, ensuring they're well-coated. Let them marinate for about 15-20 minutes.

2. **Preheat the Grill**: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If you're using a grill pan on the stovetop, heat it over medium-high as well, lightly greased.

3. **Grill the Salmon**: Place the marinated salmon on the grill, skin-side down if applicable. Grill for about 4-5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillets. The salmon should easily flake with a fork when it's cooked through, and you want to achieve a nice char on the outside.

#### Step 3: Serve
1. **Plate the Dish**: On each plate, place a generous portion of the quinoa salad. Top it with a grilled salmon fillet.

2. **Garnish (Optional)**: You can garnish with additional lemon slices or fresh herbs if desired.

Enjoy this refreshing and healthy meal that showcases the delicious flavors of grilled salmon alongside a vibrant quinoa salad!

Query: Kosher dessert for Passover
Dietary Restriction: kosher
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for **Flourless Chocolate Cake**, which is perfect for Passover and is sure to please everyone at your table. This rich and decadent cake is naturally gluten-free and can be enjoyed by all. 

### Flourless Chocolate Cake

**Servings:** 2 (but it's rich, so you might want to share with more!)

#### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- Pinch of salt
- Optional: powdered sugar or fresh berries for garnish 

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Prepare an 8-inch round cake pan by greasing it lightly with butter and lining the bottom with parchment paper. This will ensure easy removal after baking.

2. **Melt Chocolate and Butter**: In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the unsalted butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Stir frequently until the mixture is completely melted and smooth. Remove from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.

3. **Beat the Eggs**: In a large mixing bowl, crack the three eggs. Add the granulated sugar and vanilla extract. Using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat the eggs and sugar together until the mixture is thick and pale, about 5 minutes. This step helps to incorporate air for a lighter cake.

4. **Combine the Mixtures**: Once the chocolate and butter mixture has cooled slightly, carefully fold it into the egg mixture. Stir gently until fully combined. Take care not to deflate the mixture too much.

5. **Add Dry Ingredients**: Sift the unsweetened cocoa powder and a pinch of salt over the batter. Gently fold the cocoa into the mix until just combined. The batter will be thick and somewhat glossy.

6. **Pour and Bake**: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. The cake is done when the center is set but still slightly gooey.

7. **Cool and Serve**: Once removed from the oven, let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully run a knife around the edges and invert the cake onto a plate. Remove the parchment paper.

8. **Garnish**: Dust with powdered sugar or serve with fresh berries on top for an elegant touch.

9. **Indulge**: Slice the cake into generous wedges and enjoy! It pairs wonderfully with a cup of coffee or tea.

This flourless chocolate cake is a wonderful way to celebrate the sweetness of Passover, offering a rich chocolate flavor with a satisfying texture. Enjoy!

Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious recipe for **Cheesy Vegetable Quesadillas** that are nut-free and perfect for a school lunch. This dish is warm, satisfying, and packed with veggies!

### Cheesy Vegetable Quesadillas

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 4 flour tortillas (8-inch size)
- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or mozzarella)
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 1 small zucchini, grated or finely diced
- 1 small carrot, grated
- 1/2 cup corn (frozen or canned, drained)
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (optional)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Salsa or sour cream, for serving (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Veggies:** Start by washing and prepping your vegetables. Dice the bell pepper, grate the zucchini and carrot, and if using frozen corn, thaw it slightly under warm water.

2. **Sauté the Vegetables:** In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced bell pepper, grated zucchini, grated carrot, and corn. Sprinkle in the garlic powder and onion powder (if using), along with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté for about 3-5 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Remove the skillet from the heat and set the vegetable mixture aside.

3. **Assemble the Quesadillas:** On a clean, flat surface, lay out two tortillas. Evenly distribute the vegetable mixture onto each tortilla, leaving a little space around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded cheese generously over the vegetables, and then top with the remaining two tortillas.

4. **Cook the Quesadillas:** Wipe out the skillet used for the vegetables and return it to the stove over medium heat. Carefully place one quesadilla in the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, or until it’s golden brown and the cheese begins to melt. Use a spatula to flip the quesadilla and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes on the other side.

5. **Repeat with the Second Quesadilla:** After the first quesadilla is cooked, transfer it to a plate. Repeat the cooking process with the second quesadilla.

6. **Cut and Serve:** Once both quesadillas are cooked, remove them from the skillet and let them cool for a minute. Cut them into wedges. Serve warm with salsa or sour cream on the side, if desired.

3. **Assemble the Quesadillas:** On a clean, flat surface, lay out two tortillas. Evenly distribute the vegetable mixture onto each tortilla, leaving a little space around the edges. Sprinkle the shredded cheese generously over the vegetables, and then top with the remaining two tortillas.

4. **Cook the Quesadillas:** Wipe out the skillet used for the vegetables and return it to the stove over medium heat. Carefully place one quesadilla in the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, or until it’s golden brown and the cheese begins to melt. Use a spatula to flip the quesadilla and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes on the other side.

5. **Repeat with the Second Quesadilla:** After the first quesadilla is cooked, transfer it to a plate. Repeat the cooking process with the second quesadilla.

6. **Cut and Serve:** Once both quesadillas are cooked, remove them from the skillet and let them cool for a minute. Cut them into wedges. Serve warm with salsa or sour cream on the side, if desired.

### Note:
These quesadillas can be made ahead of time. Just pack them in a lunchbox with a small container of salsa or dipping sauce for a tasty school lunch. Enjoy!",text/plain,Nut-free lunch that's safe for my kid's school

Query: I'm vegan and gluten-free and also hate vegetables. What can I eat?
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for you: **Savory Chickpea Pancakes**! They’re vegan, gluten-free, and can be made without many traditional vegetables. This recipe will yield 2 servings.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup chickpea flour
- 1 cup water
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin (optional, for flavor)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (for the pan)
- Optional toppings: avocado, salsa, or vegan yogurt 

### Instructions:

1. **Make the Batter:**
   - In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of chickpea flour, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin (if using). Slowly add 1 cup of water while whisking until the batter is smooth. It should have a pouring consistency, similar to pancake batter. Let the mixture rest for about 10-15 minutes; this helps the flour to hydrate.

2. **Preheat the Pan:**
   - Heat a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and let it warm up. You can check if it’s ready by sprinkling a drop of water in the pan; if it sizzles, it’s time to cook!

3. **Cook the Pancakes:**
   - Pour about 1/2 cup of the batter into the hot pan, tilting the pan gently to spread the batter evenly into a circle. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until the edges begin to dry and the bottom is golden brown.
   - Flip the pancake carefully using a spatula and cook for another 3-4 minutes on the other side until it turns golden brown as well. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the pan as needed.

4. **Serve:**
   - Once done, serve the pancakes warm. You can top them with slices of avocado, a dollop of salsa, or a spoonful of vegan yogurt according to your preference.

These savory chickpea pancakes are not only quick and easy but also packed with protein and fiber, making them satisfying without relying heavily on vegetables. Enjoy your meal!

Query: Sugar-free dessert that doesn't taste like sadness
Dietary Restriction: sugar-free
Recipe Response: ### Sugar-Free Chocolate Avocado Mousse

This creamy, rich, and decadent dessert will satisfy your sweet tooth without any added sugar. The avocado gives it a silky texture, while cocoa powder and vanilla add incredible flavor. This recipe serves 2 people.

#### Ingredients:
- 1 ripe avocado
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (or a sugar substitute of your choice)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of sea salt
- Optional toppings: Fresh berries, unsweetened shredded coconut, or a sprinkle of chopped nuts

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Avocado**: Start by cutting the ripe avocado in half. Remove the pit and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl. Make sure the avocado is ripe; it should be slightly soft to the touch.

2. **Blend Ingredients**: Using a fork or a hand blender, mash the avocado until smooth. Add the unsweetened cocoa powder, honey (or maple syrup), vanilla extract, and a pinch of sea salt to the bowl.

3. **Mix Until Creamy**: Blend all the ingredients together until they form a creamy, smooth mousse.

4. **Taste and Adjust**: Taste your mixture and adjust sweetness or cocoa if needed. This is a crucial step to ensure the flavors are just to your liking.

5. **Chill**: Once you achieve a smooth, chocolatey consistency, transfer the mousse into individual serving bowls or cups. Cover them with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. This helps the mousse firm up and enhances the flavors.

6. **Serve**: After chilling, take the mousse out of the refrigerator. You can top it with fresh berries, shredded coconut, or chopped nuts for added texture and flavor. 

7. **Enjoy**: Serve immediately and indulge in this guilt-free, decadent dessert!

Query: Something that feels indulgent but isn't terrible for me
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Here’s a recipe for **Herb-Crusted Baked Salmon**. It’s indulgent in flavor while being healthy and packed with nutrients. This dish serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 salmon fillets (about 6 oz each)
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 cup fresh breadcrumbs (or panko)
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill, finely chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried dill)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Lemon wedges, for serving

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). This allows for even cooking and a nice crust on the salmon.

2. **Prepare the baking dish:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.

3. **Make the herb crust:** In a medium bowl, combine the fresh breadcrumbs, chopped parsley, dill, and olive oil. Mix well until the breadcrumbs are slightly moistened and all herbs are evenly distributed. Add a pinch of salt and pepper for seasoning.

4. **Prepare the salmon:** Place the salmon fillets skin-side down on the prepared baking sheet. Pat them dry with a paper towel to ensure a good sear. Brush the top of each fillet generously with Dijon mustard, ensuring a nice even layer.

5. **Apply the herb crust:** Press the breadcrumb mixture firmly onto the mustard-coated sides of the salmon fillets. Make sure to cover the surface well to form a tasty crust as it bakes.

6. **Bake the salmon:** Place the baking sheet in your preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. The breadcrumbs should be golden brown and crisp.

7. **Serve:** Remove from the oven and let sit for a minute. Serve the herb-crusted salmon with lemon wedges on the side for an added burst of flavor.

### Enjoy!
This Herb-Crusted Baked Salmon pairs wonderfully with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh green salad, making it a complete and indulgent yet healthy meal.

   - In a blender, combine the frozen banana, almond milk, and almond butter. These ingredients will form the creamy base of your smoothie. Blend on high until smooth and well-combined.

3. **Add Nutrition:**
   - Next, add the chia seeds, maple syrup (if using), vanilla extract, and spinach. Chia seeds add protein and healthy fats, while spinach boosts the nutrient profile without altering the taste significantly. Blend again until everything is well incorporated and the spinach is completely mixed in.

4. **Adjust Consistency:**
   - If the smoothie is too thick for your liking, add a little more almond milk until you reach the desired consistency. If you prefer a colder drink, throw in a few ice cubes and blend again.

5. **Taste Test:**
   - Stop blending and give it a taste. If you’d like it sweeter, add a bit more maple syrup and blend briefly to combine.

6. **Serve:**
   - Pour the smoothie into glasses and enjoy immediately. You can garnish with a sprinkle of chia seeds or a drizzle of almond butter on top if desired.

### Tips:
- Feel free to substitute the almond milk with soy milk or oat milk for a creamier texture or if you have nut allergies.
- You can add a scoop of your favorite plant-based protein powder if you're looking to increase protein content without affecting the flavor much.
- For added texture and nutrition, consider throwing in some oats or flaxseeds!

Enjoy your creamy, satisfying vegan protein smoothie!

Query: Something keto-ish but not super strict
Dietary Restriction: keto
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious and accommodating recipe for **Creamy Garlic Butter Tuscan Shrimp**. This dish is not strictly keto but is relatively low in carbohydrates and packed with flavor. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 1 lb (450g) large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cup fresh spinach
- ½ cup heavy cream
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Shrimp**: Rinse the shrimp under cold water, then pat them dry with a paper towel. Season them with salt and pepper to your liking.

2. **Heat the Oil**: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. Once hot, add the shrimp in a single layer. Sauté for about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until they turn pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set them aside on a plate.

3. **Make the Garlic Butter Sauce**: In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium. Add the butter and minced garlic. Sauté for about 30 seconds, until the garlic is fragrant but not browned.

4. **Add the Vegetables**: Toss in the halved cherry tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes, letting them soften and release their juices. Add the spinach and cook for an additional minute until wilted.

5. **Create the Creamy Sauce**: Pour in the heavy cream and stir well. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Then, add the grated Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning, stirring continuously until the cheese has melted and the sauce thickens slightly.

6. **Combine Shrimp and Sauce**: Add the cooked shrimp back into the skillet, stirring them gently to coat them with the creamy sauce. Allow everything to simmer together for 2-3 minutes to heat through.

7. **Taste and Adjust**: Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or Italian seasoning as needed.

8. **Serve**: Divide the creamy garlic butter shrimp between two plates. If desired, garnish with fresh basil leaves for an added touch of flavor and color.

Query: My kid needs a nut-free cookie recipe for school but she's super picky and only likes chocolate
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: **Nut-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies**  
*Serving Size: Makes 12-15 cookies*

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (or use a dairy-free spread if needed)
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (ensure they're nut-free)

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This will ensure your cookies bake evenly.

2. **Mix the Dry Ingredients**: In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. This helps to evenly distribute the baking soda and gives your cookies a nice rise.

3. **Cream the Butter and Sugars**: In a large mixing bowl, add the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Using an electric mixer (or a whisk if you're up for it), beat these ingredients together until the mixture is light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.

4. **Add the Egg and Vanilla**: Once your butter and sugars are creamy, add in the egg and vanilla extract. Continue mixing until everything is well combined.

5. **Incorporate the Dry Ingredients**: Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture into the wet mixture. Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon just until combined. Be careful not to over-mix, or your cookies might turn out dense.

6. **Fold in the Chocolate Chips**: Gently fold in the semi-sweet chocolate chips. This is where all the chocolate goodness comes in!

7. **Shape the Cookies**: Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, drop rounded balls of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure to leave about 2 inches of space between each cookie, as they will spread while baking.

8. **Bake**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes. You'll know they are done when the edges are golden brown, but the centers look slightly soft. 

9. **Cool the Cookies**: Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. After that, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. 

10. **Enjoy**: Your nut-free chocolate chip cookies are now ready to be enjoyed! Store them in an airtight container for freshness.

These cookies are sure to please even the pickiest of eaters!

Query: Kosher dessert for Passover
Dietary Restriction: kosher
Recipe Response: Here's a delightful recipe for **Flourless Chocolate Cake** that's perfect for Passover and is suitable for a Kosher diet. This rich and decadent dessert is sure to impress and serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 4 oz (113g) bittersweet chocolate (or semi-sweet, if preferred)
- 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup (60ml) unsalted butter (or margarine, for kosher)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup (20g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 tsp salt

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat Your Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a small round cake pan (about 6 inches) and line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Melt the Chocolate and Butter**: In a saucepan or a microwave-safe bowl, combine the bittersweet chocolate and unsalted butter. If using the stove, melt over low heat, stirring constantly until smooth. If using the microwave, heat in short intervals (15-30 seconds), stirring in between until melted. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.

3. **Whisk in Sugar and Eggs**: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, add the granulated sugar to the melted chocolate mixture and mix thoroughly. Then, crack the eggs into the bowl and add the vanilla extract. Whisk together until the mixture is smooth and shiny.

4. **Incorporate Dry Ingredients**: Sift the unsweetened cocoa powder and salt into the chocolate mixture. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients using a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; it's okay if there are a few small lumps.

5. **Pour and Bake**: Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan, smoothing the top to ensure an even layer. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes. The cake is done when the top has set and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

6. **Cool the Cake**: After baking, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Carefully run a knife around the edges to loosen it before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely.

7. **Serve**: Once cooled, you can dust the top lightly with powdered sugar or cocoa powder before slicing. This cake is delightful on its own or served with fresh berries or a dollop of whipped cream (or a non-dairy whipped topping for a Kosher option).

Query: I want something light but filling
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: **Recipe: Quinoa and Vegetable Salad**

*Serving Size: 2 People*

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water or vegetable broth
- 1 medium cucumber, diced
- 1 medium bell pepper (any color), diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: Feta cheese or avocado for topping

### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Start by rinsing 1 cup of quinoa under cold running water in a fine-mesh sieve. This helps remove the natural coating, called saponin, that can make the quinoa taste bitter.

2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of water (or vegetable broth for extra flavor). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce to low heat, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork afterwards.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooking, take the opportunity to chop your vegetables. Dice the cucumber, bell pepper, and finely chop the red onion. Halve the cherry tomatoes. Place all these chopped veggies into a large mixing bowl.

4. **Mix the Dressing**: In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This will create a light, zesty dressing for your salad.

5. **Combine the Ingredients**: Once the quinoa is cooked and has cooled slightly, add it to the bowl with the chopped vegetables. Pour the dressing over the quinoa and vegetables, then sprinkle in the chopped parsley. Mix everything together gently, ensuring that the dressing evenly coats all the ingredients.

6. **Serve**: Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or lemon juice if desired. If you like, you can top the salad with crumbled feta cheese or sliced avocado for additional flavor and creaminess.

7. **Enjoy**: Serve the quinoa and vegetable salad immediately or chill it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes for a refreshing cold treat. This salad is not only light and nutritious but also very filling, making it a perfect meal!

*Serving Size: 2 People*

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water or vegetable broth
- 1 medium cucumber, diced
- 1 medium bell pepper (any color), diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: Feta cheese or avocado for topping

### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Start by rinsing 1 cup of quinoa under cold running water in a fine-mesh sieve. This helps remove the natural coating, called saponin, that can make the quinoa taste bitter.

2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of water (or vegetable broth for extra flavor). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce to low heat, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is tender and has absorbed all the liquid. Remove from heat and let it sit covered for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork afterwards.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooking, take the opportunity to chop your vegetables. Dice the cucumber, bell pepper, and finely chop the red onion. Halve the cherry tomatoes. Place all these chopped veggies into a large mixing bowl.

4. **Mix the Dressing**: In a small bowl, whisk together 1/4 cup of olive oil, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This will create a light, zesty dressing for your salad.

5. **Combine the Ingredients**: Once the quinoa is cooked and has cooled slightly, add it to the bowl with the chopped vegetables. Pour the dressing over the quinoa and vegetables, then sprinkle in the chopped parsley. Mix everything together gently, ensuring that the dressing evenly coats all the ingredients.

6. **Serve**: Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or lemon juice if desired. If you like, you can top the salad with crumbled feta cheese or sliced avocado for additional flavor and creaminess.

7. **Enjoy**: Serve the quinoa and vegetable salad immediately or chill it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes for a refreshing cold treat. This salad is not only light and nutritious but also very filling, making it a perfect meal!

Query: Dairy-free but cheese is okay sometimes
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for **Creamy Spinach and Cheese Pasta** that balances dairy-free ingredients while allowing for cheese if you'd like a touch of creaminess. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 200g pasta (your choice)
- 2 cups fresh spinach (or frozen)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 cup vegetable broth
- 1/4 cup cashew cream (you can make it by blending soaked cashews with water)
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- Grated cheese (optional, for serving)
- Red pepper flakes (optional, for serving)

### Instructions:

1. **Cook the Pasta:** 
   In a pot, bring salted water to a rolling boil. Add your pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Once cooked, reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta water, then drain the rest and set the pasta aside.

2. **Sauté Garlic:**
   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant but not browned.

3. **Add Spinach:**
   Add the fresh spinach to the skillet with the garlic, and cook for 3-5 minutes until the spinach wilts. If using frozen spinach, ensure it’s thoroughly heated and any excess moisture evaporates.

4. **Create the Sauce:**
   Pour in the vegetable broth and bring to a simmer. After a minute, stir in the cashew cream, mixing it well into the spinach and garlic mixture. If the sauce seems too thick, add in a splash of the reserved pasta water until you reach the desired creaminess.

5. **Season:** 
   Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste. If you want a little kick, add red pepper flakes to your liking.

6. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**
   Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing everything together to ensure the pasta is well coated with the sauce. If it looks too dry, add more reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until it is just right.

7. **Serve:**
   Divide the creamy spinach and cheese pasta between two plates. If you like, sprinkle some grated cheese on top for additional creaminess and flavor. You can also add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for an extra zing.

### Enjoy your Creamy Spinach and Cheese Pasta!

This dish is not only quick but satisfying, with the beautiful green of the spinach elevating it presentation-wise, and it can easily adapt to your dietary needs while still being flavorful.

Query: Vegetarian curry but I don't eat onions or garlic for religious reasons
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here’s a delightful recipe for a **Vegetarian Coconut Curry**, without onions or garlic, that serves 2 people.

### Vegetarian Coconut Curry

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup of mixed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers, peas, cauliflower)
- 1 cup of coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil (or coconut oil)
- 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger, grated
- 1 tablespoon of curry powder
- 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder
- 1 teaspoon of cumin powder
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)
- Cooked rice or naan, for serving

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables**: If you haven't done so, chop your mixed vegetables into bite-sized pieces. This allows for even cooking and better texture in the curry.

2. **Heat the Oil**: In a medium-sized pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. You can use coconut oil for a richer flavor, especially since it pairs well with the coconut milk.

3. **Sauté the Ginger**: Once the oil is hot, add the grated ginger to the pot. Sauté it for about 1 minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning. This step will release its aromatic flavor.

4. **Add Spices**: Sprinkle in the curry powder, turmeric powder, and cumin powder. Stir the spices with the ginger for about 30 seconds, letting their fragrance fill the air. This step is crucial to activate the essential oils in the spices.

5. **Incorporate the Vegetables**: Add the mixed vegetables to the pot and stir well, coating them with the spice mixture. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the vegetables to soften slightly.

6. **Add Coconut Milk**: Pour in the coconut milk and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Once it starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the flavors meld together.

7. **Season**: Taste the curry and add salt and pepper as needed.

8. **Serve**: Once the curry is ready, you can serve it hot, garnished with fresh cilantro if desired. Enjoy it with your choice of cooked rice or warm naan to soak up all that delicious sauce.

Query: Gluten-free birthday cake for my 5-year-old who has celiac but all her friends will be eating regular cake and I don't want her to feel left out
Dietary Restriction: gluten-free
Recipe Response: **Gluten-Free Vanilla Birthday Cake**

This delightful gluten-free vanilla birthday cake is sure to bring a smile to your 5-year-old's face and make her feel special on her birthday, while still being delicious for her friends!

**Serving Size:** 8 servings

### Ingredients

**For the Cake:**
- 1 ½ cups gluten-free all-purpose flour blend (ensure it contains xanthan gum)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (plus more for greasing)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy, as preferred)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

**For the Frosting:**
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2-4 tablespoons milk (dairy or non-dairy, as preferred)
- Optional: colorful sprinkles for decoration

### Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease two 8-inch round cake pans with butter and lightly dust them with gluten-free flour or line them with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together until well combined. Set aside.

3. **Cream the Butter and Sugar:**
   In a large mixing bowl, using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the softened butter and granulated sugar together on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. **Add Eggs and Vanilla:**
   Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, add the vanilla extract and mix until just combined.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   Gradually add the dry flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Do not over-mix—it's okay if a few lumps remain.

6. **Pour into Pans:**
   Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula.

7. **Bake the Cakes:**
   Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The cakes should be lightly golden and spring back when touched.

8. **Cool Down:**
   Once baked, remove from the oven and let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully remove them from the pans and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. **Prepare the Frosting:**
   While the cakes cool, make the frosting. In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with a hand mixer or stand mixer on medium speed until creamy. Gradually add the powdered sugar, mixing until well incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and enough milk to reach your desired frosting consistency.

10. **Assemble the Cake:**
    Once the cakes are completely cool, place one layer on a cake stand or serving plate. Spread a layer of frosting on top. Place the second layer on top and apply a thin coat of frosting over the entire cake (this is called a crumb coat). Chill in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes, then frost the cake again until smooth and fluffy.

11. **Decorate:**
    If desired, decorate with colorful sprinkles and any other fun decorations to make it festive for the birthday celebration.

12. **Serve:**
    Slice the cake into wedges and enjoy with friends! Your gluten-free birthday cake is ready to shine at the celebration.

This cake not only looks fantastic but tastes amazing, ensuring your daughter feels included and loved on her special day! Enjoy!

Query: Whole30 comfort food that actually comforts
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious Whole30-compliant recipe for **Creamy Coconut Chicken Curry** that serves 2 people. It's rich, satisfying, and full of flavor, perfect for those comfort food cravings while staying within your dietary guidelines.

### Creamy Coconut Chicken Curry

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil (or olive oil)
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger, grated or minced
- 1 can (13.5 oz) coconut milk (full fat for creaminess)
- 1 tablespoon red curry paste (make sure it’s Whole30 compliant)
- 1 cup fresh spinach (or kale)
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional)
- Juice of 1 lime (optional)
  
#### Instructions:

1. **Heat the Oil**: In a medium-sized skillet, place the coconut oil over medium heat. Allow it to melt and warm up, ensuring it's evenly coated in the pan.

2. **Sauté Aromatics**: Add the chopped onion to the skillet and sauté for about 3-4 minutes, or until the onions become translucent. Stir regularly to prevent burning. Then add the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another 1 minute until fragrant.

3. **Cook the Chicken**: Toss in the chicken pieces, stirring to coat them with the aromatic mixture. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken is no longer pink on the outside, stirring occasionally to ensure even cooking.

4. **Add the Curry Paste**: Stir in the red curry paste, allowing it to blend with the chicken and onion mixture. Cook for an additional minute to develop the flavors.

5. **Incorporate Coconut Milk**: Pour in the coconut milk, stirring to combine all ingredients thoroughly. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then lower the heat slightly. If you’re using fish sauce, add it now for extra umami.

6. **Add Vegetables**: Once the curry is simmering, add the sliced red bell pepper and spinach. Cook for another 3-5 minutes, allowing the peppers to soften and the spinach to wilt into the sauce. 

7. **Adjust Seasoning**: Taste the curry and season with salt and pepper to your liking. If you prefer a bit of acidity, squeeze in lime juice for brightness.

8. **Serve**: Remove from heat and garnish with fresh cilantro if desired. Serve hot over a bed of riced cauliflower or enjoy it on its own.

1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Place the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and rinse it under cold water. This helps remove the natural bitterness of quinoa.

2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water (or vegetable broth). Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for 5 more minutes. Then, fluff it with a fork.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooking, prepare your vegetables. In a large bowl, add the halved cherry tomatoes, diced cucumber, diced bell pepper, chopped red onion, and parsley.

4. **Dress the Salad**: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to make the dressing. Pour this dressing over the vegetable mixture and toss to combine.

5. **Combine Quinoa and Vegetables**: Once the quinoa has cooled slightly, add it to the bowl with the vegetables and dressing. Gently stir everything together until well mixed.

6. **Taste and Adjust**: Taste your salad and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, or lemon juice as desired.

7. **Serve**: Divide the quinoa salad into bowls and serve. It's great either warm or chilled.

#### Serving Size: 
This recipe serves 2 people, but it can easily be doubled or halved to accommodate your needs!

Query: Kosher dessert for Passover
Dietary Restriction: kosher
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for **Flourless Chocolate Cake**, perfect for Passover and delicious regardless of dietary restrictions. This rich and decadent dessert serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 4 oz (113g) bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped
- ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
- ¼ cup (50g) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 large eggs
- ¼ cup (60ml) unsalted butter, melted (or use coconut oil for a dairy-free option)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt
- Optional: Powdered sugar for dusting
- Optional: Berries or whipped cream for serving

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). Prepare a small 6-inch round cake pan by greasing it lightly with butter or oil, and line the bottom with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Melt the Chocolate**: In a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler), combine the chopped chocolate and melted butter (or coconut oil). Stir occasionally until melted and smooth. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each until fully melted.

3. **Mix the Batter**: Once the chocolate mixture is melted and slightly cooled, add in the granulated sugar and stir until combined. The mixture will look thick at this point. Next, add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, incorporate the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt.

4. **Sift the Dry Ingredients**: In a small bowl, sift the unsweetened cocoa powder into the chocolate mixture. Gently fold the cocoa into the batter using a spatula, taking care not to overmix. You want everything to be smoothly combined but without vigorous stirring.

5. **Bake the Cake**: Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes or until the edges are set and a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter). Avoid overbaking to keep the cake fudgy.

6. **Cooling**: Allow the cake to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then run a knife around the edges and invert it onto a plate. Carefully peel off the parchment paper.

7. **Serving**: You can dust the top with powdered sugar for a beautiful presentation and serve warm or at room temperature. Pair it with fresh berries or a dollop of whipped cream for added richness and contrast.

Enjoy your **Flourless Chocolate Cake** as a delightful conclusion to your Passover meal!

Query: Low-carb pizza recipe - I miss pizza so much
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious low-carb pizza recipe that will satisfy your cravings while keeping things healthy. This recipe uses cauliflower to make the crust, making it a great alternative to traditional pizza dough.

### Low-Carb Cauliflower Pizza

#### Servings: 2

**Ingredients:**
- 1 medium head of cauliflower (about 3 cups riced)
- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 cup pizza sauce (sugar-free for a low-carb option)
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (for topping)
- Optional toppings: pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, spinach, basil, etc.

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven:** Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.

2. **Prepare the cauliflower:** Remove the leaves and core from the cauliflower, then cut it into smaller florets. Place the florets in a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice or fine crumbs. You should have about 3 cups of riced cauliflower.

3. **Cook the cauliflower:** Transfer the riced cauliflower to a microwave-safe bowl and cover it. Microwave on high for about 4-5 minutes until soft. Once cooked, allow it to cool for a couple of minutes.

4. **Remove excess moisture:** Place the cooked cauliflower into a clean kitchen towel or cheese cloth. Twist and squeeze to remove as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial to getting a crispy crust!

5. **Mix the crust ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine the riced cauliflower, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, the egg, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix until fully combined.

6. **Shape the crust:** Transfer the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Use your hands or a spatula to spread it out into a round shape (about 1/4 inch thick), making sure to create a slight edge for the crust.

7. **Bake the crust:** Place the crust in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until it’s golden brown and firm. Keep an eye on it to avoid burning.

8. **Add toppings:** Once the crust is done, take it out of the oven and spread the pizza sauce evenly over the top. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and add any additional toppings you desire.

9. **Final bake:** Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

10. **Serve:** Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a couple of minutes. Slice into wedges and serve warm. Enjoy your delicious low-carb pizza!

This caulirice pizza packs flavor and keeps the carbs low, allowing you to indulge without guilt!

Query: I'm on a sugar-free diet but I want to make candy
Dietary Restriction: sugar-free
Recipe Response: For a delicious sugar-free candy option, I recommend making Sugar-Free Peanut Butter Cups. This recipe serves 2, so you can indulge without overdoing it!

### Sugar-Free Peanut Butter Cups

#### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup natural peanut butter (make sure it's unsweetened)
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (melted)
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 cup sugar-free sweetener (e.g., erythritol or stevia, to taste)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare Your Molds**: Start by preparing a silicone candy mold or a mini muffin tin. If you’re using a muffin tin, line it with cupcake liners for easier removal.

2. **Make the Chocolate Mixture**: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the melted coconut oil, unsweetened cocoa powder, sugar-free sweetener, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Stir well until the mixture is smooth and fully combined. This will be your chocolate coating.

3. **Add the First Layer**: Pour a small amount (about a tablespoon) of the chocolate mixture into each mold or muffin cup, just enough to cover the bottom. Place the mold in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes until the chocolate sets.

4. **Add Peanut Butter Filling**: While the chocolate base is setting, in another bowl, mix the natural peanut butter with a little bit of salt (just a pinch). Once the chocolate is firm, take the mold out from the freezer and spoon the peanut butter mixture on top of the chocolate layer, filling each mold about halfway or to your preferred taste.

5. **Top with More Chocolate**: Cover the peanut butter layer with the remaining chocolate mixture, ensuring it completely seals the peanut butter. Tap the mold gently to remove any air bubbles and smooth the tops.

6. **Freeze**: Place the mold back into the freezer for about 30 minutes or until completely set. 

7. **Serve**: Once firm, carefully remove the peanut butter cups from the mold. They can be enjoyed immediately or stored in an airtight container in the fridge for later.

### Paleo Almond Flour Bread

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups almond flour
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/4 cup flaxseed meal (ground flaxseeds)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any non-dairy milk)
- 1 tablespoon raw honey (optional for sweetness)

2. **Prepare Your Baking Pan:**
   Line a small loaf pan (about 8x4 inches) with parchment paper, or lightly grease it with coconut oil to prevent sticking.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:**
   In a large bowl, sift together the almond flour, coconut flour, flaxseed meal, baking soda, and salt. Mixing these ingredients thoroughly is crucial to ensure even distribution of the leavening agent.

   Transfer the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Use a spatula to smooth the top, making it as even as possible.

7. **Bake:**
   Place the loaf pan into the preheated oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes. The bread is done when it has risen and turned a golden brown color. A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.

8. **Cool:**

Query: Nut-free lunch that's safe for my kid's school
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious and nut-free recipe for **Cheesy Vegetable Quesadillas** that is perfect for a kid’s school lunch. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 4 small whole wheat tortillas
- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or mozzarella works well)
- 1 cup mixed vegetables (like bell peppers, spinach, and corn)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Salsa (optional, for dipping)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - If you're using fresh vegetables, wash and chop them into small bite-sized pieces. You can use a mix of bell peppers, spinach, and corn for a colorful, nutrient-packed filling. If you have frozen mixed vegetables, just thaw them as per the package instructions.

2. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   - In a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. 
   - Add the chopped vegetables to the skillet. If you're using garlic powder, add it now. 
   - Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes or until they are tender and slightly golden. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Assemble the Quesadillas:**
   - Place one tortilla flat on a clean surface. On one half of the tortilla, sprinkle a layer of shredded cheese (about ¼ cup). Top the cheese with a generous scoop of the sautéed vegetables. Then, sprinkle another layer of cheese on top of the vegetables (this helps to bind everything together). Fold the tortilla over to create a half-moon shape.
   - Repeat this process with the remaining tortillas.

4. **Cook the Quesadillas:**
   - Wipe the skillet clean and return it to the heat, adding a little more olive oil if necessary. You want just enough oil to coat the pan.
   - Carefully place the folded quesadilla in the skillet. Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the bottom is golden brown and crispy.
   - Flip the quesadilla gently using a spatula, and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes on the other side until it’s golden brown and the cheese is melted.

5. **Slice and Serve:**
   - Once cooked, remove the quesadilla from the skillet and let it sit for a minute. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to slice it into wedges.
   - Serve warm, with a side of salsa for dipping if desired.

### Storage:
These quesadillas can be packed in a lunchbox. If you want to make them ahead of time, simply refrigerate them in an airtight container; they can be enjoyed cold or warmed up in a microwave before serving.

This recipe is a great mix of protein, veggies, and cheesy goodness, making it a tasty and safe option for kids. Enjoy!

Dietary Restriction: pescatarian
Recipe Response: I have the perfect recipe for you: Lemon Garlic Butter Shrimp Pasta. This dish is not only pescatarian-friendly but also free of shellfish, making it safe and delicious. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 8 oz spaghetti or linguine
- 1 lb shrimp (peeled and deveined)

- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)

### Instructions:

1. **Cook the Pasta**: In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the spaghetti or linguine according to the package instructions, usually around 8-10 minutes, until al dente. Reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta and set it aside.

2. **Prepare the Shrimp**: While the pasta cooks, pat the shrimp dry with paper towels. Season them lightly with salt and pepper.

3. **Sauté the Garlic**: In a large skillet over medium heat, add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Once the butter has melted, add the minced garlic. Sauté for about 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned.

5. **Make the Sauce**: In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, lemon zest, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir to combine and let it cook for about 1 minute, allowing the flavors to meld.

6. **Combine Pasta and Shrimp**: Return the shrimp to the skillet with the sauce. Add the cooked pasta and toss everything together to coat the pasta thoroughly in the lemon garlic butter sauce. If the mixture seems dry, gradually add some reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.

7. **Serve and Garnish**: Remove from heat, taste, and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary. Plate the pasta and shrimp, then garnish generously with freshly chopped parsley. For an extra touch, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top if desired.

Query: I'm diabetic but I want to make a fruit cake for Christmas. My grandmother's recipe has tons of sugar and dried fruit but it's tradition and I can't just skip it this year. Is there any way to modify it so I can still participate in the family tradition without spiking my blood sugar?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Absolutely! You can make a delicious diabetic-friendly fruit cake that maintains the essence of traditional flavors while being mindful of sugar content. Here’s a modified recipe for a Diabetic-Friendly Fruit Cake that serves 2 people.

### Diabetic-Friendly Fruit Cake

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup mixed dried fruit (look for unsweetened varieties like raisins, cranberries, or apricots)
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce (this will help add moisture and sweetness)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup chopped nuts (such as walnuts or almonds, optional)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of nutmeg (optional)
- Zest of 1 orange (for added flavor)
- 3 tablespoons sugar substitute (like stevia or erythritol, adjust to taste)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Fruit**: In a bowl, soak the mixed dried fruit in warm water for about 10-15 minutes. This helps soften the fruit and brings out its natural sweetness. After soaking, drain it and set aside.

2. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Prepare a small loaf pan (around 5x7 inches) by greasing it lightly or lining it with parchment paper.

3. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, ground cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg (if using). This ensures that the baking soda and spices are evenly distributed.

4. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, mix the unsweetened applesauce, eggs, vanilla extract, and orange zest until well combined. You want the mixture to be smooth and thoroughly blended.

5. **Combine Dry and Wet Mixtures**: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Do not overmix! Fold in the soaked dried fruit and nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the batter.

6. **Bake the Cake**: Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, spreading it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The edges may be golden brown.

7. **Cool and Serve**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. 

8. **Enjoy!**: Slice the cake once it's completely cool. It can be served plain, or you can enjoy it with a little cream cheese spread for added indulgence.

#### Storage:
Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

This fruit cake allows you to keep the tradition alive without compromising your health. Enjoy making it and being part of the family celebrations!

Query: I want something light but filling
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: Here's a delightful recipe for **Lemon Herb Quinoa Salad** that’s light yet filling, perfect for a refreshing meal.

### Lemon Herb Quinoa Salad

#### Servings: 2

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water
- 1 lemon (juiced and zested)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes (halved)
- 1 cucumber (diced)
- 1/4 cup red onion (finely chopped)
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley (chopped)
- 1/4 cup feta cheese (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa:**
   Start by rinsing the quinoa under cold water in a fine mesh strainer. This helps remove the natural coating, called saponin, which can make it taste bitter.

2. **Cook the Quinoa:**
   In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and 2 cups of water. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa has absorbed all the water. Remove from heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 minutes.

3. **Fluff the Quinoa:**
   After the quinoa has absorbed all the water, use a fork to fluff it. Set it aside to cool for a few minutes.

4. **Prepare the Dressing:**
   In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, salt, and black pepper until well combined. This will add a bright flavor to the salad.

5. **Combine the Ingredients:**
   In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion, and parsley. Pour the lemon dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine, making sure all the ingredients are coated evenly.

6. **Add Feta (if using):**
   If you like feta cheese, crumble it over the top of the salad and give it one last gentle toss.

7. **Serve:**
   Divide the salad into two bowls or plates. This dish can be served immediately, but it tastes even better if you let it sit for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Enjoy your light yet filling Lemon Herb Quinoa Salad!

Feel free to customize it by adding any other vegetables or proteins like grilled chicken or chickpeas for added nutrition!

Query: I want something light but filling
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for **Lemon Herb Quinoa Salad**. This dish is light, refreshing, and filling, making it perfect for a satisfying meal. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups water or vegetable broth (for extra flavor)
- 1 medium cucumber, diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/4 red onion, finely chopped
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped (or more, to taste)
- 1/4 cup fresh mint or basil, chopped (optional)
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Begin by rinsing the quinoa under cold water in a fine mesh sieve. This removes the natural coating called saponin that can give quinoa a bitter taste.

2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water (or vegetable broth for added flavor). Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover with a lid, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the quinoa is cooked and has absorbed all the liquid. You’ll know it’s ready when you see the little spirals (the germ) separating from the seeds.

3. **Fluff and Cool**: After cooking, remove the saucepan from heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5 minutes. Then, uncover and fluff the quinoa with a fork. Spread it out on a plate or a large shallow dish to cool slightly.

4. **Prepare the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooling, prepare your vegetables. Dice the cucumber, halve the cherry tomatoes, and finely chop the red onion. If using, chop the fresh herbs—parsley, mint, or basil.

5. **Make the Dressing**: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper. This dressing will bring all the flavors together beautifully.

6. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa, diced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, parsley, and any additional herbs you’re using. Pour the lemon dressing over the mixture. Gently toss everything together until well-combined, ensuring the dressing evenly coats the ingredients.

7. **Taste and Adjust**: Before serving, taste the salad and adjust seasoning as needed, adding more salt, pepper, or lemon juice to your preference.

8. **Serve**: Divide the lemon herb quinoa salad between two plates or bowls. This dish can be enjoyed immediately, but it also tastes great after chilling in the fridge for a while, allowing the flavors to meld.

Recipe Response: Great to hear! I have a delicious and healthy recipe for you: **Lemon Garlic Herb Grilled Chicken**. This dish is light, flavorful, and perfect for a clean-eating approach. 

### Lemon Garlic Herb Grilled Chicken

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:** In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Whisk together until well combined. Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish, and pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it is well-coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and let it marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, but ideally 1-2 hours for best flavor.

2. **Preheat the Grill:** Preheat your grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. If using a grill, make sure the grates are clean and lightly oiled to prevent sticking.

3. **Grill the Chicken:** Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off, then place the chicken on the preheated grill. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side without moving it. This allows nice grill marks to form. Flip the chicken and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes on the other side until it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C).

4. **Rest the Chicken:** Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest on a cutting board for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring moist and tender chicken.

5. **Serve:** Slice the grilled chicken and transfer it to a plate. Optionally, garnish with fresh parsley. This dish pairs well with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh green salad.

Enjoy your clean and delicious Lemon Garlic Herb Grilled Chicken! It's simple, full of flavor, and a real treat for any healthy meal.

Query: I want paleo bread but every recipe I've tried is terrible
Dietary Restriction: paleo
Recipe Response: Let’s make a delicious and simple Paleo Almond Flour Bread. This recipe yields about 2 servings.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsweetened apple cider vinegar
- 2 tbsp honey (optional for sweetness)
- 1 tbsp olive oil or melted coconut oil

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This is crucial for achieving a nice rise in your bread.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk them together until they are well incorporated. This dry mixture is the base of your bread and helps it rise.

3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, crack the three eggs and add the olive oil (or melted coconut oil), apple cider vinegar, and honey if you’re using it. Whisk these ingredients together until you achieve a smooth mixture.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures**: Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix well with a spatula until everything is well combined and forms a thick batter. The mixture will be somewhat dense.

5. **Form the Bread**: Line a small loaf pan (about 5x3 inches) with parchment paper for easy removal later. Transfer the batter into the pan, smoothing out the top with a spatula. Make sure to spread it evenly so it bakes uniformly.

6. **Bake**: Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes. The bread should turn a golden brown, and you can check for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center; it should come out clean.

This recipe yields about 2 servings.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsweetened apple cider vinegar
- 2 tbsp honey (optional for sweetness)
- 1 tbsp olive oil or melted coconut oil

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This is crucial for achieving a nice rise in your bread.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk them together until they are well incorporated. This dry mixture is the base of your bread and helps it rise.

3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, crack the three eggs and add the olive oil (or melted coconut oil), apple cider vinegar, and honey if you’re using it. Whisk these ingredients together until you achieve a smooth mixture.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures**: Pour the wet mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Mix well with a spatula until everything is well combined and forms a thick batter. The mixture will be somewhat dense.

5. **Form the Bread**: Line a small loaf pan (about 5x3 inches) with parchment paper for easy removal later. Transfer the batter into the pan, smoothing out the top with a spatula. Make sure to spread it evenly so it bakes uniformly.

6. **Bake**: Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 25-30 minutes. The bread should turn a golden brown, and you can check for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center; it should come out clean.

7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 5-10 minutes. Then transfer it to a cooling rack to cool completely. Allowing it to cool helps in firming up the texture.

8. **Slice and Serve**: Once cooled, slice your bread into thick slices. It’s great toasted or topped with your favorite Paleo-friendly spreads, such as avocado, nut butter, or even homemade jam.

Query: Something keto-ish but not super strict
Dietary Restriction: keto
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious recipe for **Creamy Garlic Parmesan Chicken**. This dish is flavorful and satisfying, while keeping with a low-carb mindset. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (optional)
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken:** Season both sides of the chicken breasts generously with salt and pepper.

2. **Sear the Chicken:** In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken breasts to the skillet. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through (the internal temperature should reach 165°F). Once done, remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside on a plate.

3. **Make the Sauce:** In the same skillet, reduce the heat to medium, and add the minced garlic. Sauté the garlic for about 30 seconds, or until it's fragrant; be careful not to let it brown.

4. **Add Cream and Cheese:** Pour in the heavy cream, stirring to combine with the garlic. Gradually add the grated Parmesan cheese, mixing until smooth. If using, stir in the Italian seasoning. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 2-3 minutes until it slightly thickens.

5. **Combine Chicken and Sauce:** Return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet, spooning the creamy sauce over them. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for another 2-3 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the chicken to reheat.

6. **Serve:** Plate the chicken, drizzling extra sauce over the top. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and flavor. 

### Enjoy!
Serve your creamy garlic Parmesan chicken with a side of steamed vegetables or a fresh salad for a complete meal.

6. **Serve:** Plate the chicken, drizzling extra sauce over the top. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and flavor.

Query: I'm pescatarian but I hate fish. Can you give me a seafood pasta recipe?
Dietary Restriction: pescatarian
Recipe Response: Absolutely! Here’s a delightful recipe for **Shrimp Scampi Pasta** that emphasizes the flavors of seafood without relying on fish.

### Shrimp Scampi Pasta

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 200g (7 oz) spaghetti or linguine
- 200g (7 oz) large shrimp, peeled and deveined
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 cup white wine (or vegetable broth for non-alcoholic option)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice (freshly squeezed)
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Grated Parmesan cheese (optional for serving)

#### Instructions:

1. **Cook the Pasta:** 
   - Begin by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti or linguine and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes). Reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Shrimp:** 
   - While the pasta is cooking, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes. Sauté for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant—make sure not to let it burn.

3. **Cook the Shrimp:**
   - Add the shrimp to the skillet. Season with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until they turn pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set them aside on a plate.

4. **Deglaze the Pan:**
   - In the same skillet, pour in the white wine (or vegetable broth) and let it simmer for about 2 minutes to reduce slightly, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. This will enhance the flavor.

5. **Combine Ingredients:**
   - Lower the heat to medium and add the lemon juice and zest to the skillet. Stir to combine. Return the shrimp to the skillet, along with the cooked pasta and reserved pasta water. Toss everything together to coat the pasta and shrimp in the sauce. If the mixture seems dry, you can add a bit more pasta water.

6. **Finishing Touches:**
   - Stir in the chopped parsley and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Allow everything to heat through for another minute.

7. **Serve:**
   - Divide the shrimp scampi pasta onto two plates, and if desired, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on top before serving. Garnish with extra parsley for a fresh touch.

Enjoy your flavorful Shrimp Scampi Pasta! It's sure to be a hit even if you're not a fan of fish.

Query: I want a cheeseburger but I'm dairy-free and vegetarian. I know this sounds impossible but I'm really craving the taste and texture of a classic American cheeseburger and I haven't had one in 3 years since I went vegetarian and developed lactose intolerance
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have the perfect recipe for you! Let's make a delicious **Dairy-Free Vegetarian Cheeseburger** that captures the classic taste and texture while adhering to your dietary preferences. This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup black beans, drained and rinsed (or 1 can)
- 1/2 cup cooked quinoa
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs (use gluten-free if desired)
- 1/4 cup diced onion
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp cumin
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 tbsp olive oil (for cooking)
- 2 slices dairy-free cheese (such as almond or coconut-based)
- 2 whole grain burger buns (check that they're dairy-free)
- Lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Pickles (optional)
- Vegan mayo (optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Burger Mixture:**
   - In a medium mixing bowl, mash the black beans with a fork until they are mostly smooth but still have some texture. This will provide the base for your burger.
   - Add the cooked quinoa, breadcrumbs, diced onion, minced garlic, smoked paprika, and cumin to the mashed beans. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Mix everything together until well combined. If the mixture feels too wet, add a bit more breadcrumbs; if it's too dry, add a splash of water or more cooked quinoa.

2. **Form the Patties:**
   - Divide the mixture into two equal parts and shape each part into a burger patty. Make sure they’re firm and well-formed to avoid breaking during cooking.

3. **Cook the Patties:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmery, carefully add the patties to the skillet.
   - Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until they are golden brown and heated through. In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of dairy-free cheese on top of each patty. Cover the skillet with a lid to help melt the cheese.

4. **Toast the Buns:**
   - While the patties are cooking, you can toast the burger buns in a separate pan or a toaster until they are lightly golden. This adds a nice crunch and prevents them from getting soggy.

5. **Assemble the Burgers:**
   - On the bottom half of each toasted burger bun, place a lettuce leaf, followed by the cheesy black bean quinoa patty. Top it with a slice of tomato, pickles, and a dollop of vegan mayo if desired. Garnish with the top half of the bun.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve your dairy-free vegetarian cheeseburgers with a side of sweet potato fries or a fresh salad. Enjoy your satisfying and flavorful cheeseburger!

This recipe offers a hearty bite reminiscent of classic cheeseburgers, while being completely dairy-free and vegetarian. Enjoy your meal!

- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

- 1 ripe banana, mashed
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil)
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar

#### For the Frosting:
- 1/4 cup coconut cream (chilled overnight)
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup (or to taste)

### Instructions

#### Making the Cake:
1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a small cake pan (around 6 inches) with a little oil or line it with parchment paper.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, sift together the whole wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. This helps to aerate the flour and incorporate air, ensuring a light cake.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, combine the mashed banana, maple syrup, almond milk, vegetable oil, and apple cider vinegar. Whisk them together until smooth. The vinegar and baking soda will help the cake rise and create a fluffy texture.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined (do not over-mix; a few lumps are okay).

5. **Bake the Cake:** Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 

6. **Cool the Cake:** Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.

#### Making the Frosting:
7. **Prepare the Frosting:** While the cake is cooling, scoop the chilled coconut cream into a bowl. Whip it with a hand mixer (or whisk vigorously) until it’s light and fluffy. 

8. **Sweeten the Frosting:** Add maple syrup and cocoa powder to the whipped coconut cream. Mix until fully combined. Taste and adjust the sweetness or cocoa to your preference.

#### Assemble the Cake:
9. **Frost the Cake:** Once the cake is completely cool, spread the vegan chocolate frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake using a spatula.

10. **Serve:** Slice the cake into 2 pieces and enjoy your delicious, refined-sugar-free, vegan chocolate cake on your special day!

Query: Keto meal that doesn't make me feel gross
Dietary Restriction: keto
Recipe Response: **Keto Lemon Garlic Butter Shrimp**

This delightful dish offers a fresh, tangy flavor with the richness of butter, keeping it satisfying without the heaviness. It serves 2 people and is perfect for a light yet filling keto meal.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined (fresh or frozen)
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 lemon (juice and zest)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Optional: 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes for a bit of heat

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Shrimp:** If your shrimp are frozen, thaw them by placing them in a bowl of cold water for about 15 minutes. Once thawed, ensure they are fully peeled and deveined. Pat them dry lightly with a paper towel and set aside.

2. **Melt the Butter:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat until melted and foamy.

3. **Sauté Garlic:** Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic as it can turn bitter.

4. **Cook the Shrimp:** Increase the heat to medium-high, then add the shrimp to the skillet in a single layer. Season them with salt, black pepper, and if using, the red pepper flakes. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the shrimp turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook them.

5. **Add Lemon Flavor:** Once the shrimp are cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Then, pour in the juice of the lemon and add the lemon zest. Stir gently to coat the shrimp in the lemon garlic butter sauce, allowing the flavors to meld for about 1 minute.

6. **Garnish and Serve:** Remove the skillet from the heat and sprinkle the chopped parsley over the top. Give it a gentle stir to combine. Serve the shrimp warm, alongside a fresh green salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.

1. **Prepare the Shrimp:** If your shrimp are frozen, thaw them by placing them in a bowl of cold water for about 15 minutes. Once thawed, ensure they are fully peeled and deveined. Pat them dry lightly with a paper towel and set aside.

2. **Melt the Butter:** In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter over medium heat until melted and foamy.

3. **Sauté Garlic:** Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for about 30 seconds, just until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic as it can turn bitter.

4. **Cook the Shrimp:** Increase the heat to medium-high, then add the shrimp to the skillet in a single layer. Season them with salt, black pepper, and if using, the red pepper flakes. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until the shrimp turn pink and opaque. Be careful not to overcook them.

5. **Add Lemon Flavor:** Once the shrimp are cooked, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet. Then, pour in the juice of the lemon and add the lemon zest. Stir gently to coat the shrimp in the lemon garlic butter sauce, allowing the flavors to meld for about 1 minute.

6. **Garnish and Serve:** Remove the skillet from the heat and sprinkle the chopped parsley over the top. Give it a gentle stir to combine. Serve the shrimp warm, alongside a fresh green salad or steamed vegetables for a complete meal.

Query: Whole30 compliant dinner that my non-Whole30 husband will actually eat
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious Whole30 compliant recipe that even your husband will enjoy: **Garlic Herb Chicken with Roasted Vegetables**. This dish is full of flavor and satisfying, making it perfect for both Whole30 adherents and those who aren’t. This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
**For the Chicken:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried rosemary
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Juice of 1 lemon

**For the Roasted Vegetables:**
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 cup carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1 bell pepper, cut into bite-sized pieces (any color)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken Marinade:**
   - In a medium bowl, combine the minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, rosemary, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. This will create a fragrant marinade for the chicken.

2. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - Place the chicken breasts in the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Allow them to marinate for at least 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours if you have the time) in the refrigerator to absorb the flavors.

3. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This temperature will help achieve a nice roast on the vegetables while cooking the chicken perfectly.

4. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - On a large baking sheet, toss the broccoli, carrots, and bell pepper with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Make sure the vegetables are evenly coated. Spread them out in a single layer for even roasting.

5. **Roasting the Vegetables:**
   - Place the baking sheet with the vegetables in the preheated oven. Roast them for about 20 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly caramelized.

6. **Cook the Chicken:**
   - While the vegetables are roasting, heat a skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add a little olive oil if the pan isn’t non-stick.
   - Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess drip off, and carefully place it in the hot skillet. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side until golden brown, then flip the chicken and reduce the heat to medium. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). Remove the chicken from the skillet and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing.

7. **Serve:**
   - Divide the roasted vegetables between two plates and top with sliced garlic herb chicken. Optionally, drizzle with a little more lemon juice or garnish with fresh herbs if desired.

Query: Paleo spaghetti and meatballs
Dietary Restriction: paleo
Recipe Response: **Paleo Spaghetti and Meatballs**

This delicious recipe serves 2 people and offers a healthier twist on a classic dish. Instead of traditional pasta, we’ll use spiralized zucchini, also known as ""zoodles,"" paired with flavorful meatballs made from lean ground meat.

### Ingredients:
#### For the Meatballs:
- 1 pound ground beef or turkey
- 1/4 cup almond flour
- 1 large egg
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (oregano, basil, and thyme blend)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Olive oil, for cooking

#### For the Sauce:
- 1 can (15 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- Salt and pepper, to taste

#### For the Zoodles:
- 2 medium zucchinis

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Meatballs
1. **Preheat your oven** to 400°F (200°C).
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef or turkey, almond flour, egg, minced garlic, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix until all ingredients are just combined; be careful not to overmix.
3. Form the mixture into small meatballs, about 1- to 1.5-inch in diameter, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

#### Step 2: Bake the Meatballs
4. Once your oven is preheated, place the meatballs in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they are cooked through and golden brown. You can also use a skillet to brown them on the stovetop, cooking for about 4-5 minutes per side instead of baking.

#### Step 3: Make the Sauce
5. While the meatballs bake, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. 
6. Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine.
7. Let the sauce simmer gently for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Stir occasionally to keep it from sticking.

#### Step 4: Prepare the Zoodles
8. While the sauce is simmering, wash and dry the zucchinis. Use a spiralizer to create zucchini noodles. If you don’t have a spiralizer, you can use a vegetable peeler to create thin slices.
9. Once spiralized, lightly salt the zoodles and let them sit for about 5 minutes. This helps draw out excess moisture. After resting, gently pat them dry with a paper towel.

#### Step 5: Serve the Dish
10. In a skillet over medium heat, lightly sauté the zoodles for 2-3 minutes until they are tender but still slightly crisp. Be careful not to overcook them, as they can become mushy.
11. To serve, place the zoodles on plates and top with the meatballs and generous spoonfuls of tomato sauce.
12. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired, and enjoy your healthy, Paleo spaghetti and meatballs!

This dish is not only satisfying but also versatile, allowing you to swap different meats or herbs according to your preference. Enjoy your meal!

Query: Kosher dessert for Passover
Dietary Restriction: kosher
Recipe Response: Here's a delightful recipe for Chocolate Coconut Macaroons, a classic kosher dessert that’s perfect for Passover. This recipe serves 2 people, so you can enjoy a sweet treat without too much leftover.

### Chocolate Coconut Macaroons:

#### Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups shredded unsweetened coconut
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup almond flour (or finely ground almonds)
- 2 large egg whites
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips or dairy-free chocolate chips for a vegan option

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 325°F (165°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the macaroons from sticking.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the shredded coconut, granulated sugar, and almond flour. Stir them together until well mixed. The almond flour adds a nice texture and flavor to the macaroons.

3. **Prepare Egg Whites**: In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until they become frothy. You want to achieve soft peaks; this helps give the macaroons their airy texture. 

4. **Combine Ingredients**: Gently fold the frothy egg whites into the coconut mixture. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites too much. Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, and gently combine everything until the mixture is moist but not soupy.

5. **Shape the Macaroons**: Using a tablespoon or a small ice cream scoop, drop the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. You can shape them into rounded mounds for a rustic look.

6. **Bake**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the macaroons are firm to the touch.

7. **Cool the Macaroons**: Once baked, remove the macaroons from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

This recipe serves 2 people, so you can enjoy a sweet treat without too much leftover.

### Chocolate Coconut Macaroons:

#### Ingredients:
- 1 ½ cups shredded unsweetened coconut
- 1/3 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup almond flour (or finely ground almonds)
- 2 large egg whites
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips or dairy-free chocolate chips for a vegan option

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 325°F (165°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the macaroons from sticking.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the shredded coconut, granulated sugar, and almond flour. Stir them together until well mixed. The almond flour adds a nice texture and flavor to the macaroons.

3. **Prepare Egg Whites**: In another bowl, whisk the egg whites until they become frothy. You want to achieve soft peaks; this helps give the macaroons their airy texture. 

4. **Combine Ingredients**: Gently fold the frothy egg whites into the coconut mixture. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites too much. Add the vanilla extract and a pinch of salt, and gently combine everything until the mixture is moist but not soupy.

5. **Shape the Macaroons**: Using a tablespoon or a small ice cream scoop, drop the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 1 inch apart. You can shape them into rounded mounds for a rustic look.

6. **Bake**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the macaroons are firm to the touch.

7. **Cool the Macaroons**: Once baked, remove the macaroons from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. 

8. **Melt the Chocolate**: While the macaroons are cooling, melt the chocolate chips. You can do this in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave, heating in 30-second intervals, stirring in between until smooth, or use a double boiler.

9. **Dip the Macaroons**: Once the macaroons are cool, dip the bottom half of each one into the melted chocolate, then place them back on the wire rack for the chocolate to set. Alternatively, you can drizzle the melted chocolate over the top of each macaroon for a more decorative touch.

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). This will allow the vegetables to roast to a perfect golden brown.

3. **Roast the Vegetables**: While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the vegetables. On a baking sheet, toss the diced zucchini, red bell pepper, carrot, and red onion with olive oil, salt, pepper, oregano, and garlic powder. Spread them out evenly on the sheet. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they are tender and slightly caramelized, stirring halfway through to ensure even cooking.

4. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa and the roasted vegetables. Add in the chopped parsley if you’re using it for an extra burst of freshness.

5. **Dress the Salad**: Squeeze the juice of one lemon over the quinoa and vegetable mixture. Toss everything together gently to combine, ensuring the lemon juice is evenly distributed.

Query: My kid needs a nut-free cookie recipe for school but she's super picky and only likes chocolate
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Absolutely! Here's a simple and delicious nut-free chocolate cookie recipe that's sure to please even the pickiest eaters. This recipe makes about 12 cookies, perfect for 2 people or for a small batch to share.

### Nut-Free Chocolate Cookies

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (or use a dairy-free alternative if needed)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips (make sure they are nut-free)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.

2. **Prepare the Baking Sheet:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will help prevent the cookies from sticking and make for easy cleanup.

3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt until they are well combined. This helps distribute the leavening agents evenly throughout the flour.

4. **Cream Butter and Sugars:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Using an electric mixer or a sturdy whisk, beat them together until the mixture is light and fluffy—about 2-3 minutes.

5. **Add Egg and Vanilla:** Beat in the egg and vanilla extract to the butter and sugar mixture. Continue mixing until fully incorporated.

6. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed or by hand just until combined. Do not overmix!

7. **Fold in Chocolate Chips:** Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula. Make sure they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

8. **Scoop Cookies:** Using a tablespoon or a cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie for spreading.

9. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. They will continue to firm up as they cool.

10. **Cool the Cookies:** Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Serving Suggestions:
These cookies taste best when served warm, but they can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week. Enjoy with a glass of cold milk or a warm cup of tea!

Here's a simple and delicious nut-free chocolate cookie recipe that's sure to please even the pickiest eaters. This recipe makes about 12 cookies, perfect for 2 people or for a small batch to share.

### Nut-Free Chocolate Cookies

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (or use a dairy-free alternative if needed)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips (make sure they are nut-free)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that your cookies bake evenly.

2. **Prepare the Baking Sheet:** Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. This will help prevent the cookies from sticking and make for easy cleanup.

3. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt until they are well combined. This helps distribute the leavening agents evenly throughout the flour.

4. **Cream Butter and Sugars:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Using an electric mixer or a sturdy whisk, beat them together until the mixture is light and fluffy—about 2-3 minutes.

5. **Add Egg and Vanilla:** Beat in the egg and vanilla extract to the butter and sugar mixture. Continue mixing until fully incorporated.

6. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed or by hand just until combined. Do not overmix!

7. **Fold in Chocolate Chips:** Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula. Make sure they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

8. **Scoop Cookies:** Using a tablespoon or a cookie scoop, drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving space between each cookie for spreading.

9. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft. They will continue to firm up as they cool.

10. **Cool the Cookies:** Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Serving Suggestions:
These cookies taste best when served warm, but they can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week. Enjoy with a glass of cold milk or a warm cup of tea!

Query: Whole30 compliant dinner that my non-Whole30 husband will actually eat
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious Whole30-compliant recipe that even your non-Whole30 husband will likely enjoy. Let’s make **Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Roasted Vegetables**. This dish is fresh, flavorful, and beautifully balanced.

### Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Roasted Vegetables

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients

**For the Grilled Chicken:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

**For the Roasted Vegetables:**
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 cup bell peppers, sliced (any color)
- 1 small zucchini, sliced
- 1 carrot, sliced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

#### Instructions

1. **Marinate the Chicken**: In a bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is coated well. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours if you have time for more flavor).

2. **Preheat the Oven**: While the chicken is marinating, preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) for the roasted vegetables.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables**: In a large bowl, combine the broccoli, bell peppers, zucchini, and carrot. Drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss everything together until the vegetables are evenly coated.

4. **Roast the Vegetables**: Spread the vegetable mixture on a baking sheet in a single layer. Place in the preheated oven and roast for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly crispy on the edges. Toss halfway through cooking to ensure even roasting.

5. **Grill the Chicken**: While the vegetables are roasting, preheat your grill (or grill pan) over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade. Grill the chicken for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked (the internal temperature should reach 165°F or 75°C). Let the chicken rest for a few minutes after cooking.

6. **Serve**: Slice the grilled chicken breasts and serve alongside the roasted vegetables on plates. Drizzle any remaining lemon juice over the chicken and vegetables for extra flavor.

### Enjoy!

Query: I want a cheeseburger but I'm dairy-free and vegetarian. I know this sounds impossible but I'm really craving the taste and texture of a classic American cheeseburger and I haven't had one in 3 years since I went vegetarian and developed lactose intolerance
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for a dairy-free and vegetarian cheeseburger that will satisfy your cravings! This recipe features a hearty black bean patty topped with dairy-free cheese, providing both the taste and texture reminiscent of a classic cheeseburger. This recipe serves 2.

### Dairy-Free and Vegetarian Cheeseburger

**Ingredients:**

**For the Black Bean Patties:**
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs (use gluten-free if necessary)
- 1/4 cup finely chopped onions
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (for cooking)
  
**For Assembly:**
- 2 dairy-free burger buns
- 2 slices dairy-free cheese (such as cashew or almond-based)
- Lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Pickles (optional)
- Ketchup, mustard, or any condiments of your choice

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Black Bean Mixture:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, add the drained and rinsed black beans. Using a fork or a potato masher, mash the beans until mostly smooth, leaving some chunks for texture.
   - Stir in the breadcrumbs, chopped onions, minced garlic, ground cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Mix everything until well combined. If the mixture feels too wet, add a little more breadcrumbs until it holds together.

2. **Form the Patties:**
   - Divide the mixture into two equal portions and shape them into patties about ½ inch thick. Place them on a plate and refrigerate for about 15 minutes to firm up.

3. **Cook the Patties:**
   - Heat the olive oil in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the black bean patties. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on one side until golden brown. Gently flip the patties and cook for another 5-6 minutes, adding a slice of dairy-free cheese on top of each patty during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.

4. **Toast the Buns:**
   - While the patties are cooking, you can toast the burger buns. You can do this in a toaster or on a skillet until lightly golden.

5. **Assemble the Burgers:**
   - On the bottom half of each toasted bun, place a lettuce leaf followed by a slice of tomato. Carefully place the black bean patty with melted dairy-free cheese on top. Add pickles and your favorite condiments. Finally, crown with the top half of the bun.

6. **Serve:**
   - Serve warm, alongside some sweet potato fries or a salad for a complete meal.

Query: Low-sodium soup recipe - my doctor says I need to cut back
Dietary Restriction: low-sodium
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious and comforting low-sodium Vegetable Soup recipe that serves 2 people. It's nutritious, hearty, and packed with flavor without the added salt.

### Low-Sodium Vegetable Soup

#### Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium carrot, diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 1 medium potato, peeled and diced
- 1 cup green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces (fresh or frozen)
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 cup diced tomatoes (canned, no salt added)
- Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   Start by washing and chopping all your vegetables as described above. Ensure that your onion, garlic, carrot, celery, potato, green beans, and zucchini are all ready to go.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics:**
   In a medium-sized pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until it's translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute, stirring to prevent it from burning.

3. **Add Harder Vegetables:**
   Stir in the diced carrot, celery, and potato into the pot. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will help to release their natural sweetness.

4. **Incorporate Green Beans and Zucchini:**
   Next, add the green beans and zucchini. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, continuing to stir frequently.

5. **Add Broth and Seasonings:**
   Pour in the low-sodium vegetable broth. Add the dried thyme, dried basil, black pepper, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil.

6. **Simmer:**
   Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the soup simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are tender.

7. **Final Touches:**
   Stir in the canned tomatoes (with their juice) and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you'd like more flavor, consider adding a splash of lemon juice or a sprinkle of vinegar for brightness.

8. **Serve:**
   Remove the bay leaf before serving. Ladle the soup into bowls and, if desired, garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and freshness.

Enjoy your heartwarming low-sodium vegetable soup! This recipe is perfect for lunch or dinner, providing a wholesome and satisfying meal while being easy on your salt intake.

It's nutritious, hearty, and packed with flavor without the added salt.

### Low-Sodium Vegetable Soup

#### Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 medium carrot, diced
- 1 stalk celery, diced
- 1 medium potato, peeled and diced
- 1 cup green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces (fresh or frozen)
- 1 zucchini, diced
- 4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 cup diced tomatoes (canned, no salt added)
- Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   Start by washing and chopping all your vegetables as described above. Ensure that your onion, garlic, carrot, celery, potato, green beans, and zucchini are all ready to go.

2. **Sauté the Aromatics:**
   In a medium-sized pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until it's translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute, stirring to prevent it from burning.

3. **Add Harder Vegetables:**
   Stir in the diced carrot, celery, and potato into the pot. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. This will help to release their natural sweetness.

4. **Incorporate Green Beans and Zucchini:**
   Next, add the green beans and zucchini. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, continuing to stir frequently.

5. **Add Broth and Seasonings:**
   Pour in the low-sodium vegetable broth. Add the dried thyme, dried basil, black pepper, and bay leaf. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil.

6. **Simmer:**
   Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the soup simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are tender.

7. **Final Touches:**
   Stir in the canned tomatoes (with their juice) and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you'd like more flavor, consider adding a splash of lemon juice or a sprinkle of vinegar for brightness.

8. **Serve:**
   Remove the bay leaf before serving. Ladle the soup into bowls and, if desired, garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and freshness.

Query: Gluten-free pizza dough that actually tastes good and isn't cardboard
Dietary Restriction: gluten-free
Recipe Response: ### Delicious Gluten-Free Pizza Dough

**Servings:** 2 (makes one medium pizza)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder (optional for flavor)
- 1/2 cup warm water (about 110°F/43°C)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and place a pizza stone or an upside-down baking sheet inside to warm up.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder. Whisk together until evenly mixed. This will be the basis of your dough and gives it flavor.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, combine the warm water, olive oil, and apple cider vinegar. Stir until mixed.

4. **Form the Dough**: Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon until a dough starts to form. You might find it easier to use your hands to knead the dough gently for about 1-2 minutes. The dough should be slightly sticky but still manageable. If it’s too wet, add a little more flour, a tablespoon at a time.

5. **Shape the Dough**: Place the dough on a piece of parchment paper. Sprinkle a little gluten-free flour on top to prevent sticking. With your hands, gently press the dough into a circle about 10-12 inches in diameter, creating a slight raise at the edges for the crust.

6. **Pre-bake the Crust**: Transfer the parchment paper with the dough onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet. Bake for about 10 minutes, just until the edges start to lightly brown and firm up.

7. **Add Toppings**: Remove the pre-baked crust from the oven. Add your favorite pizza sauce, cheese, and toppings of choice. Go for the classics like pepperoni, bell peppers, or mushrooms, or get creative with fresh basil and mozzarella.

8. **Final Bake**: Return the topped pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges of the crust are golden brown.

9. **Cool and Serve**: Once done, carefully remove the pizza from the oven. Let it cool for a couple of minutes, then slice it up and enjoy your delicious homemade gluten-free pizza!

This dough is flavorful and has a great texture, unlike cardboard alternatives. Enjoy your meal!

- 1 teaspoon garam masala
- Salt to taste

5. **Season**: After simmering, stir in the lemon juice and add salt to taste. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.

6. **Serve**: Serve the chickpea curry over a bed of cooked rice or quinoa for a hearty meal. You can also garnish it with fresh herbs if you like (coriander or parsley work well), but they are optional.

1. **Sauté Aromatics**: In a medium saucepan, heat the coconut oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the minced garlic and ginger. Sauté for about 1 minute, stirring frequently, until fragrant but not browned.

2. **Add Spices**: Sprinkle in ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. Cook for another minute, allowing the spices to toast slightly. This step will enhance the flavors of the curry.

3. **Add Chickpeas and Coconut Milk**: Now, add the drained and rinsed chickpeas into the pan, stirring to combine them with the sautéed aromatics and spices. Pour in the coconut milk and stir well.

4. **Simmer the Curry**: Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the curry thickens slightly. If it becomes too thick, you can add a splash of water to reach your desired consistency.

5. **Season**: After simmering, stir in the lemon juice and add salt to taste. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.

6. **Serve**: Serve the chickpea curry over a bed of cooked rice or quinoa for a hearty meal. You can also garnish it with fresh herbs if you like (coriander or parsley work well), but they are optional.

Query: Vegan chocolate cake for my birthday but I'm also trying to avoid refined sugar
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for a Vegan Chocolate Cake that uses natural sweeteners, perfect for celebrating your birthday without refined sugar! This recipe serves 2 people.

### Vegan Chocolate Cake (Refined Sugar-Free)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup whole wheat flour (or any preferred flour)
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup ripe bananas (about 1 large banana, mashed)
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/4 cup maple syrup (or agave syrup)
- 1/4 cup almond milk (or any plant-based milk)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a small cake pan (6-inch round or similar) with a bit of oil or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, unsweetened cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Whisk these together until they are well mixed and there are no lumps.

3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients**: In another bowl, combine the mashed banana, unsweetened applesauce, maple syrup, almond milk, vanilla extract, and vegetable oil. Mix until all the ingredients are well incorporated and smooth.

4. **Combine Mixtures**: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Gently fold the mixtures together using a spatula, being careful not to over-mix; you want to combine everything just until there are no flour streaks visible.

5. **Bake the Cake**: Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan. Smooth the top with the spatula if necessary. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs (but no wet batter).

6. **Cool the Cake**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. After that, carefully transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

7. **Serve**: Once cooled, you can enjoy it as is or dust it with a little powdered cocoa or serve it alongside fresh fruit. If you want to elevate it even more, consider making a simple frosting with a banana and a bit of cocoa powder blended together; this will keep it refined sugar-free.

And there you have it—a delicious vegan chocolate cake that's perfect for your birthday while steering clear of refined sugars. Enjoy your special day!

2. **Prep the Bell Peppers:**
   - While the quinoa is cooking, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

4. **Stuff the Peppers:**
   - Take the cooked quinoa mixture and spoon it into each bell pepper, filling them generously.
   - Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. If desired, sprinkle shredded cheese on top of each filled pepper for a delicious cheesy crust.

5. **Bake:**
   - Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
   - Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, until the peppers are tender and the tops are slightly golden.

Recipe Response: **Recipe: Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies**

**Serving Size:** 2 people (approximately 6 cookies)

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (melted)
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup honey or pure maple syrup (if non-diabetic)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (at least 70% cocoa)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cookies from sticking.

2. **Mix Wet Ingredients:** In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Stir them together until you have a smooth mixture. Then, crack in the egg and whisk it in thoroughly until the mixture is well combined and slightly frothy.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, mix the almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Make sure to break up any clumps in the almond flour for an even texture.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring gently until everything is combined into a thick dough. To ensure a smooth consistency, avoid over-mixing.

5. **Add Chocolate Chips:** Fold in the dark chocolate chips using a spatula or spoon, making sure they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

6. **Shape the Cookies:** Using tablespoon-sized portions of dough, scoop and roll them into balls. Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between each one as they will spread slightly during baking.

7. **Flatten Cookies:** Gently press down on each dough ball with the back of a spoon to flatten them slightly. This ensures more even baking.

8. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes until the edges are golden brown. The cookies will appear soft; they will firm up as they cool.

9. **Cool Down:** Once done, remove the baking sheet from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. **Serve:** Enjoy your delicious almond flour chocolate chip cookies while they're fresh, or store any leftovers in an airtight container for a tasty treat later!

These cookies are not only diabetic-friendly but also gluten-free and made with nutritious ingredients. Enjoy!

Query: Dairy-free but cheese is okay sometimes
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have a wonderful recipe for a **Creamy Tomato Basil Pasta** that can be dairy-free but includes cheese for flavor. This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
- 8 ounces of pasta (such as spaghetti or penne)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 (14-ounce) can of crushed tomatoes
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped (plus extra for garnish)
- 1/4 cup dairy-free cream (or regular cream if desired)
- 1/4 cup grated cheese (Parmesan or dairy-free alternative), optional

### Instructions:

1. **Cook the Pasta**: Start by bringing a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Once cooked, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water, and then drain the pasta.

2. **Prepare the Sauce**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds or until fragrant, being careful not to let it burn.

3. **Add Tomatoes and Seasoning**: Pour in the crushed tomatoes and stir in the dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper. Allow the sauce to bubble gently, cooking for about 5-7 minutes until it thickens slightly.

4. **Incorporate the Cream**: Stir in the dairy-free cream (or regular cream), which will give the sauce a rich, creamy texture. Add the chopped basil and mix until well combined. Let it simmer for another 2 minutes.

5. **Combine with Pasta**: Add the drained pasta to the skillet and toss it in the sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add some reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency. 

6. **Add Cheese**: If using cheese, sprinkle it over the pasta and toss lightly to combine.

7. **Serve**: Divide the Creamy Tomato Basil Pasta between two plates. Garnish with additional fresh basil and, if desired, a sprinkle of extra cheese.

Query: I don't like vegetables but I want to eat healthy
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I understand! Let’s prepare a flavorful and healthy Chicken and Quinoa Bowl that hides some nutrition while being delicious. This recipe serves 2.

### Chicken and Quinoa Bowl Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup quinoa
- 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth (or water)
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for extra flavor)
- Fresh herbs (like parsley or cilantro) for garnish (optional)
- Lemon wedges for serving

#### Instructions:

1. **Rinse the Quinoa**: Start by rinsing the quinoa under cool running water in a fine mesh strainer. This helps remove any bitterness. Drain well.

2. **Cook the Quinoa**: In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and chicken broth (or water). Bring it to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes, or until all the liquid is absorbed. Turn off the heat and let it stand, covered, for another 5 minutes. Fluff it with a fork when done.

3. **Prepare the Chicken**: While the quinoa is cooking, take the chicken breasts and pat them dry with a paper towel. This helps them sear nicely. Season both sides of the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and pepper.

4. **Cook the Chicken**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the seasoned chicken breasts. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is cooked through and has a golden-brown crust. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C). Once done, remove them from the skillet and let them rest for a couple of minutes.

5. **Assemble the Bowl**: Slice the chicken into thin strips. In a serving bowl, place a generous amount of the cooked quinoa as the base. Arrange the sliced chicken on top.

6. **Optional Garnishes**: If you have fresh herbs, sprinkle them over the chicken and quinoa for a burst of freshness. Serve with lemon wedges on the side for a zesty kick—just squeeze some lemon juice over the top before enjoying!

### Enjoy!
This Chicken and Quinoa Bowl is not only satisfying but also packed with protein and fiber, promoting a healthy meal without heavy reliance on vegetables. Enjoy your delicious, nutritious dish!

This delicious and nutritious berry chia pudding is packed with fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants, making it an excellent choice for a diabetic-friendly dessert.

#### Ingredients:
- 1/4 cup chia seeds

- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup mixed fresh berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)

4. **Prepare the Berries:** Just before serving, wash and gently pat dry the mixed fresh berries. You can slice larger berries (like strawberries) if you like.

5. **Assemble the Pudding:** Once the chia pudding has set and thickened, remove it from the refrigerator. Give it a good stir to ensure even consistency. Spoon the pudding into serving bowls.

6. **Top with Berries:** Layer the fresh berries generously on top of the chia pudding. If desired, sprinkle with a handful of chopped nuts for added crunch and nutrition.

**Serving Size:** 2 people

**Ingredients:**
- 1 pound (450g) large shrimp, peeled and deveined

- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 cup fresh spinach
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Shrimp:** Rinse the shrimp under cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season them lightly with salt and pepper.

2. **Heat the Pan:** In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once hot, add the shrimp in a single layer. Cook for about 2-3 minutes per side, or until the shrimp is pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set aside on a plate.

Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful recipe for a **Vegetarian Coconut Chickpea Curry** that is both flavorful and free of onions and garlic. This dish serves 2 people and is perfect for a cozy meal. 

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup canned chickpeas (rinsed and drained)
- 1 can (14 oz) coconut milk
- 1 medium carrot, diced
- 1 bell pepper (any color), diced
- 1 medium potato, diced
- 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated (or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger)
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil or coconut oil
- Fresh cilantro (for garnish)
- Cooked rice or quinoa (for serving)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the vegetables:** Start by washing and chopping the carrot, bell pepper, and potato into small, bite-sized pieces. This will ensure they cook evenly.

2. **Heat the oil:** In a medium-sized saucepan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. If you're using coconut oil, it may take a bit longer to melt.

3. **Add ginger:** Once the oil is hot, add the grated ginger. Sauté it for about 30 seconds until it's fragrant, making sure not to let it brown.

4. **Cook the vegetables:** Add the diced carrot and potato to the pan. Stir well to coat them in the oil, then cover the saucepan and allow them to cook for about 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften.

5. **Add bell pepper and spices:** Next, add the diced bell pepper, curry powder, turmeric powder, and cumin powder. Stir everything together to mix the spices evenly with the vegetables. Cook for another 2 minutes to let the spices become aromatic.

6. **Add chickpeas and coconut milk:** Pour in the drained chickpeas and the can of coconut milk. Stir well to combine everything. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer.

7. **Simmer the curry:** Reduce the heat to low and let the curry simmer uncovered for about 15-20 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and the vegetables to cook through. Stir occasionally, and if you notice the curry is getting too thick, you can add a splash of water to reach your desired consistency.

8. **Season the curry:** After simmering, season the curry with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the spices to your liking if needed.

9. **Serve:** Once everything is cooked and the flavors have developed, remove the curry from the heat. Serve it hot over cooked rice or quinoa. Garnish with fresh cilantro for a vibrant touch.

- 2 cups mixed greens (such as spinach, arugula, or kale)
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 cup cucumber, diced
- 1 carrot, grated
- 1 avocado, sliced
- 1/4 cup red onion, finely sliced
- 1/2 cup corn (fresh, frozen, or canned)
- 1/4 cup walnuts or sunflower seeds (for crunch)

For the Dressing:
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice (freshly squeezed)
- 1 teaspoon maple syrup (or agave nectar)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- A sprinkle of garlic powder (optional) for extra flavor
- Fresh herbs (such as parsley or cilantro) for garnish

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Veggies:** Start by washing all your vegetables thoroughly. Dry them with a clean kitchen towel or salad spinner. 

2. **Chop and Dice:** In a large mixing bowl, take your mixed greens and tear them into bite-sized pieces. Add the halved cherry tomatoes, diced red bell pepper, diced cucumber, grated carrot, sliced avocado, finely sliced red onion, and corn. 

3. **Make the Dressing:** In a small bowl or a jar with a lid, combine olive oil, apple cider vinegar, lemon juice, and maple syrup. If that garlic powder appeals to you, add a pinch. Whisk together or shake vigorously until emulsified. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Adjust the sweetness or acidity according to your preference.

4. **Combine Salad and Dressing:** Pour the dressing over the chopped vegetables. Using salad tongs or your hands, gently toss the salad to ensure everything is well-coated in the dressing.

Query: I'm trying to eat clean but I want pizza
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious and healthy recipe for **Cauliflower Crust Pizza** that allows you to enjoy pizza while keeping it clean and nutritious. This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
- 1 medium head cauliflower, riced (about 2 to 3 cups)
- 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (part-skim for a healthier option)
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Fresh basil or spinach (optional for topping)
- Tomato sauce (preferably no added sugar) 
- Additional toppings of your choice (like bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms)

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent sticking.

2. **Rice the Cauliflower**: Remove the leaves and stem from the cauliflower. Cut it into florets and then pulse in a food processor until it resembles rice or fine crumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a box grater.

3. **Cook the Cauliflower**: Place the riced cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on high for about 4-5 minutes until tender. Let it cool for a few minutes. Once it’s cool enough to handle, use a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth to squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial for a crispy crust!

4. **Make the Crust Mixture**: In a large mixing bowl, combine the riced cauliflower, shredded mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, egg, garlic powder, dried oregano, and salt. Mix until fully combined. The mixture should be somewhat sticky and hold together.

5. **Form the Crust**: Transfer the cauliflower mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Using your hands or a spatula, spread the mixture into a round pizza shape about 1/4 inch thick.

6. **Bake the Crust**: Bake in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden brown and the crust is firm.

7. **Add Sauce and Toppings**: Remove the crust from the oven and spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the top. Add your choice of toppings and sprinkle more mozzarella cheese on top if desired.

8. **Final Bake**: Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.

9. **Serve**: Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil or spinach if you like.

Query: Halal BBQ recipe for summer
Dietary Restriction: halal
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious recipe for Halal BBQ Chicken Skewers, perfect for a summer gathering! This recipe serves 2 people.

### Halal BBQ Chicken Skewers

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (or a halal alternative)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- Salt to taste
- Wooden or metal skewers (if using wooden, soak them in water for 30 minutes)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade:**
   In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, minced garlic, paprika, ground cumin, black pepper, and a pinch of salt. Whisk everything together until it's well-blended.

2. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   Cut the chicken breasts into approximately 1-inch cubes. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring that all pieces are well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. If you have more time, marinating for a few hours or overnight enhances the flavor.

3. **Preheat the Grill:**
   Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If you are using a charcoal grill, let the coals burn until they are covered with white ash. For a gas grill, preheating for about 10-15 minutes should suffice.

4. **Skewer the Chicken:**
   Once the chicken is marinated, take the skewers and thread the chicken pieces onto them, leaving a little space between each piece for even cooking. If you like, you can also add bell peppers, onions, or cherry tomatoes to the skewers for extra flavor and color.

5. **Grill the Skewers:**
   Place the skewers on the preheated grill. Cook for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is fully cooked and has nice grill marks. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).

6. **Serve and Enjoy:**
   Once done, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a couple of minutes. Serve the BBQ chicken skewers with a side of fresh salad, rice, or flatbreads. You may also drizzle some extra lemon juice over the skewers for added brightness.

### Tip:
Feel free to customize your skewers with different vegetables or spices based on your preference. Enjoy your delicious Halal BBQ Chicken Skewers on a sunny day!

### Lemon Herb Baked Cod

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cod fillets (about 6 ounces each)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Lemon slices (for garnish, optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Prepare the Baking Dish**: Lightly grease a baking dish with a small amount of olive oil or line it with parchment paper for easy cleanup.

3. **Make the Marinade**: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper. This mixture will infuse the fish with bright flavor and keep it moist.

4. **Coat the Cod**: Place the cod fillets in the baking dish. Pour the marinade over the fillets, ensuring they are well coated. You can gently rub the marinade into the fish to ensure even coverage.

5. **Let it Rest**: Allow the coated fillets to sit for about 10-15 minutes at room temperature. This will enhance the flavor as the fish absorbs some of the marinade.

6. **Bake the Cod**: Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork and is opaque in the center. The timing may vary slightly depending on the thickness of your cod fillets.

7. **Serve**: Once done, carefully remove from the oven. Transfer the cod to plates, drizzle any remaining pan juices over the top, and garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices if desired.

5. **Let it Rest**: Allow the coated fillets to sit for about 10-15 minutes at room temperature. This will enhance the flavor as the fish absorbs some of the marinade.

6. **Bake the Cod**: Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes or until the fish flakes easily with a fork and is opaque in the center. The timing may vary slightly depending on the thickness of your cod fillets.

7. **Serve**: Once done, carefully remove from the oven. Transfer the cod to plates, drizzle any remaining pan juices over the top, and garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices if desired.

### Enjoy!
This Lemon Herb Baked Cod is light, refreshing, and pairs wonderfully with a side of steamed vegetables or a light salad. Enjoy your meal!",text/plain,I'm pescatarian but shellfish makes me sick

Query: I'm dairy-free but pregnant and craving ice cream constantly
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have a delightful recipe for you: Dairy-Free Banana Ice Cream! This treat is not only creamy and delicious but also nutritious and easy to make. 

### Dairy-Free Banana Ice Cream

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 ripe bananas
- 1 tablespoon almond milk (or any dairy-free milk of your choice)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- A pinch of sea salt (to enhance the sweetness)
- Optional toppings: chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, or fresh fruit

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Bananas:** Start by peeling the ripe bananas. It's best to use bananas that are spotty and brown for maximum sweetness and creaminess.

2. **Slice the Bananas:** Chop the bananas into small pieces, about 1-inch thick. This will help them freeze and blend more easily.

3. **Freeze the Bananas:** Place the banana slices in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Freeze them for at least 2-3 hours, or until completely frozen. This step is crucial for achieving that creamy ice cream texture.

4. **Blend the Frozen Bananas:** Once the banana slices are frozen, transfer them to a food processor. Add the tablespoon of almond milk, vanilla extract (if using), and a pinch of sea salt. 

5. **Process Until Creamy:** Blend on high speed. Initially, it might look crumbly, but be patient! Scrape down the sides as needed. Continue blending until you have a smooth, creamy texture, resembling soft-serve ice cream.

6. **Taste and Adjust:** Give it a taste. If you like it sweeter, you can add a drizzle of maple syrup or another sweetener to your liking and blend again.

7. **Serve Immediately:** For soft-serve style ice cream, scoop it into bowls right away and enjoy! If you prefer a firmer texture, transfer it to an airtight container and freeze for an additional 30-60 minutes before serving.

8. **Add Toppings:** Get creative with toppings! You can sprinkle some chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, or fresh fruit on top to add some extra flavor and texture.

### Enjoy!
This Dairy-Free Banana Ice Cream is a healthy and satisfying alternative to traditional ice cream. It’s packed with natural sweetness and is entirely plant-based, making it perfect for your dairy-free needs. Enjoy your treat!

Query: I want to make a birthday cake but I'm diabetic. Something that still tastes good?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious and diabetic-friendly recipe for a **Almond Flour Chocolate Cake** that is not only lower in carbs but still packs a rich chocolate flavor. 

### Almond Flour Chocolate Cake (Serves 2)

#### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup sugar substitute (like erythritol or stevia, adjust according to sweetness preference)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- Optional: 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (sugar-free if available)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease an 8-inch round cake pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt until well combined. This ensures that your leavening agent is evenly distributed throughout the flour.

3. **Prepare the Wet Ingredients**: In another large mixing bowl, beat the eggs until fluffy. Then, add your sugar substitute, vanilla extract, and unsweetened applesauce. Mix thoroughly until the mixture is smooth and well incorporated.

4. **Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients**: Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring gently until just combined. If you're using sugar-free dark chocolate chips, fold them in at this point for an extra chocolatey touch.

5. **Pour into Pan**: Pour the batter into your prepared cake pan, smoothing the top with a spatula to ensure even cooking.

6. **Bake the Cake**: Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Be careful not to overbake, as almond flour cakes can dry out quickly.

7. **Cool**: Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. **Serve**: Once the cake has cooled, slice it and serve as is, or enjoy it with a dollop of sugar-free whipped cream or fresh berries if desired.

### Tips:
- Remember to taste the batter for sweetness before baking, since sugar substitutes can vary in sweetness.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.

This cake is rich, moist, and satisfying without the sugar spike, making it perfect for a birthday celebration! Enjoy!

Query: I'm dairy-free but pregnant and craving ice cream constantly
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for **Coconut Milk Ice Cream** that’s dairy-free and perfect for satisfying your ice cream cravings during pregnancy! This recipe serves 2.

### Ingredients:
- 1 can (13.5 oz) full-fat coconut milk
- 1/4 cup pure maple syrup (or to taste)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of sea salt
- Optional mix-ins: dairy-free chocolate chips, fruit puree, or nuts

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare Your Ingredients**: Start by gathering all your ingredients. Open the can of coconut milk and give it a good stir. You can use an electric mixer or a whisk to combine things smoothly if you prefer.

2. **Mix the Base**: In a mixing bowl, combine the coconut milk, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and a pinch of sea salt. Whisk together until well combined and smooth. Taste the mixture and adjust the sweetness with more maple syrup if desired.

3. **Add Mix-Ins**: If you'd like to include any mix-ins, such as dairy-free chocolate chips, fruit puree (like mashed bananas or strawberry puree), or nuts, now is the time to add them to the mixture. Stir gently to distribute evenly.

4. **Chill the Mixture**: Transfer the mixture to an airtight container and cover it. Place it in the refrigerator for about 1 hour to chill. This step helps improve the final texture.

5. **Churn the Ice Cream**: If you have an ice cream maker, pour the chilled coconut mixture into the ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s instructions (typically about 20-25 minutes). If you don’t have an ice cream maker, you can still make it by freezing it in a shallow dish.

6. **Freeze for Texture**: Once churned, transfer the ice cream into an airtight container. If using the shallow dish method, simply pour in the mixture and freeze it. Allow it to freeze for at least 4 hours until it becomes firm. If you're using the shallow dish method, remember to stir the mixture every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours to break up ice crystals and ensure creamy texture.

7. **Serve and Enjoy**: When you're ready to enjoy, scoop out your delicious coconut milk ice cream into bowls. You can top it with some fresh fruit or a drizzle of dairy-free chocolate sauce if you like!

### Tips:
- Store any leftovers in the freezer, but remember to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften before scooping the next time.

Query: I don't like vegetables but I want to eat healthy
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for **Honey Garlic Chicken** that is not only flavorful but also packed with protein, helping you maintain a healthy diet without relying on vegetables.

### Honey Garlic Chicken Recipe

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/3 cup honey
- 1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium if preferred)
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (or rice vinegar)
- Pinch of red pepper flakes (optional, for a bit of heat)
- Fresh parsley or green onions for garnish (optional)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken:**
   Start by patting the chicken breasts dry with paper towels. This helps in achieving a nice sear. Season both sides with salt and pepper to taste.

2. **Heat the Oil:**
   In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken breasts to the skillet. 

3. **Sear the Chicken:**
   Sear the chicken for about 5-6 minutes on one side without moving it, allowing a golden crust to form. Flip the chicken and sear the other side for another 5-6 minutes, until cooked through and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). Once done, remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.

4. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Be careful not to burn it. Lower the heat to medium, then add in the honey, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes if using. Stir the mixture well and bring it to a gentle simmer.

5. **Glaze the Chicken:**
   Return the seared chicken breasts to the skillet, turning them to coat with the sauce. Let it simmer in the sauce for about 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.

6. **Serve:**
   Once the chicken is well coated and the sauce is sticky, remove it from heat. You can slice the chicken or serve it whole. Drizzle any remaining sauce from the skillet over the top. For an optional garnish, sprinkle with chopped fresh parsley or green onions.

7. **Enjoy!**
   Serve the honey garlic chicken alongside your choice of side dish, such as rice or quinoa, to absorb the delicious sauce. This will make for a hearty and delightful meal!

This recipe is simple, quick, and full of flavor, making it a great healthy option without relying on vegetables. Enjoy your cooking!

Query: I'm vegan and gluten-free and also hate vegetables. What can I eat?
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for you that is both vegan and gluten-free, and it highlights flavors without relying heavily on vegetables. Let’s make **Spiced Chickpea and Sweet Potato Patties**!

### Ingredients:
- 1 can (15 oz) of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1 medium sweet potato (about 1 cup, cooked and mashed)
- 1 cup gluten-free oats 
- 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Olive oil for frying

### Serving Size:
This recipe makes approximately 4 patties, enough for 2 servings.

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Sweet Potato**: Start by cooking the sweet potato. You can either boil it until tender (about 15 minutes) or poke holes in it and microwave it for about 5-7 minutes until soft. Once cooked, peel and mash the sweet potato in a bowl.

2. **Activate the Flaxseed**: In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed with 2 tablespoons of water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it forms a gel-like consistency. This will act as a binding agent for your patties.

3. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, add the rinsed chickpeas and use a fork or potato masher to gently mash them. You don’t want a completely smooth mixture; leaving some chickpeas whole adds texture to your patties. 

4. **Mix in Remaining Ingredients**: Add the mashed sweet potato, activated flaxseed mixture, gluten-free oats, cumin, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper to the chickpeas. Mix everything until well combined.

5. **Form Patties**: Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape them into patties, roughly 1/2 inch thick. If the mixture feels too wet, add a bit more gluten-free oats until it holds together.

6. **Cook the Patties**: In a non-stick skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the patties to the skillet (cooking in batches if necessary to avoid crowding). Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.

7. **Serve**: Once cooked, remove the patties from the skillet and let them drain on a paper towel. Serve warm, and you can enjoy them with a side of tahini sauce, avocado, or your favorite vegan dipping sauce.

**Enjoy your Spiced Chickpea and Sweet Potato Patties! They’re packed with protein and flavor, and you might find that they’re a tasty way to enjoy wholesome ingredients without a strong veggie presence.**

Query: Raw vegan dessert for a potluck that won't weird people out
Dietary Restriction: raw vegan
Recipe Response: **Raw Vegan Chocolate Avocado Mousse**

This indulgent Raw Vegan Chocolate Avocado Mousse is rich, creamy, and surprisingly simple to make. It’s perfect for a potluck and will satisfy even the most skeptical dessert lovers. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 1 ripe avocado
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 3 tablespoons maple syrup (or agave syrup)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of sea salt
- Fresh berries or nuts for garnish (optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Avocado**: Start by slicing the ripe avocado in half. Remove the pit and scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender.

2. **Blend the Ingredients**: Add the unsweetened cocoa powder, maple syrup, vanilla extract, and a pinch of sea salt to the food processor. The sea salt will help to balance the sweetness, enhancing the rich chocolate flavor.

3. **Process Until Smooth**: Blend the mixture on high speed until it’s entirely smooth and creamy. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl a couple of times to ensure everything is well mixed. The final texture should be thick and velvety.

4. **Taste and Adjust**: Give the mousse a taste! If you want it sweeter, you can add a little more maple syrup. Blend again to combine any added sweetener.

5. **Chill the Mousse**: Transfer the mousse to serving bowls or glasses. For the best flavor, refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow it to firm up slightly and the flavors to meld.

6. **Garnish and Serve**: Once chilled, you can garnish your mousse with fresh berries or a sprinkle of nuts for added texture. Serve it with a spoon and watch your friends delight in the creamy, chocolatey goodness!

This dessert is not only delicious but also packed with healthy fats from the avocado, making it a great guilt-free treat for your potluck. Enjoy!

Query: Nut-free lunch that's safe for my kid's school
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious and nutritious Nut-Free Turkey and Avocado Wrap that is perfect for a school lunch!

### Nut-Free Turkey and Avocado Wrap

**Serving Size:** 2 Servings

**Ingredients:**
- 2 large whole wheat or spinach tortillas
- 4 slices of deli turkey (or your choice of deli meat)
- 1 ripe avocado
- 1 medium tomato, thinly sliced
- 1 cup of mixed greens (like spinach, romaine, or lettuce)
- 2 tablespoons of cream cheese or hummus (for spreading)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: Slices of cucumber or bell peppers for extra crunch

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Avocado:** Start by cutting the avocado in half, removing the pit, and scooping out the flesh into a medium bowl. Mash it gently with a fork until it reaches a smooth consistency. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper for added flavor.

2. **Spread the Base:** Lay one tortilla flat on a clean surface or cutting board. Take 1 tablespoon of cream cheese or hummus and spread it evenly over the surface of the tortilla. This will add creaminess and help the fillings stick.

3. **Layer the Ingredients:** On top of the spread, lay two slices of turkey. Then, generously spread half of the mashed avocado onto the turkey. Next, add slices of tomato and a handful of mixed greens. If you’re adding cucumber or bell peppers, layer them on now for added crunch.

4. **Wrap It Up:** Starting from one end, carefully lift the tortilla and begin to roll it over the fillings, tucking them in gently as you go. Roll it tightly until you reach the other end of the tortilla. Once fully rolled, you can slice it in half at a diagonal for easier eating.

5. **Repeat:** Repeat the process with the second tortilla and remaining ingredients to make the second wrap.

6. **Serving Suggestions:** You can serve these wraps as they are or with a side of baby carrots, sliced fruits, or a small bag of popcorn for a complete lunch.

### Storage:
- If you're packing these for school, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap or in a reusable container to maintain freshness until lunchtime.

Enjoy your nut-free turkey and avocado wraps! They're not only delicious but also a great way to fuel your child’s day at school.

3. **Combine and Flavor:**
   - Once the vegetables are cooked, add the cooked quinoa to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables.
   - Pour in the gluten-light soy sauce (or tamari) and sesame oil, if using. Stir everything together gently to combine. Allow the mixture to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

It serves 4, so you can easily divide it into portions for two people for multiple breakfasts throughout the week.

### Keto Breakfast Casserole

#### Ingredients:
- 6 large eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (or your favorite cheese)
- 1 cup cooked breakfast sausage (or bacon), crumbled 
- 1 cup spinach, chopped (fresh or frozen works)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or butter (for greasing the pan)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Prepare the Baking Dish:** Grease a 9x9 inch baking dish with olive oil or butter to ensure that the casserole does not stick.

3. **Cook the Meat:** In a skillet over medium heat, cook the breakfast sausage until browned and cooked through. If using bacon, chop it into small pieces and cook until crispy. Once cooked, drain excess grease and set aside.

4. **Mix the Egg Base:** In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the 6 large eggs and 1 cup of heavy cream until well combined. Add in the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Make sure the mixture is smooth and fully incorporated.

5. **Combine Ingredients:** Add the cooked sausage (or bacon), chopped spinach, and 1 cup of shredded cheese into the egg mixture. Stir until all ingredients are evenly distributed.

6. **Pour into Baking Dish:** Carefully pour the egg and meat mixture into the prepared baking dish. Make sure to spread it out evenly.

7. **Top with Cheese (Optional):** If you’d like an extra cheesy top, sprinkle a bit more cheese on top of the casserole.

8. **Bake:** Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the casserole is puffed up and the edges are starting to turn golden brown. A toothpick should come out clean when inserted in the center.

9. **Cool and Cut:** Once done, remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool slightly. Cut it into squares.

10. **Store and Reheat:** Divide the casserole into meal prep containers. These can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. To reheat, simply microwave a portion until warmed through.

### Serving Suggestion:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Prepare the Baking Dish:** Grease a 9x9 inch baking dish with olive oil or butter to ensure that the casserole does not stick.

3. **Cook the Meat:** In a skillet over medium heat, cook the breakfast sausage until browned and cooked through. If using bacon, chop it into small pieces and cook until crispy. Once cooked, drain excess grease and set aside.

4. **Mix the Egg Base:** In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the 6 large eggs and 1 cup of heavy cream until well combined. Add in the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Make sure the mixture is smooth and fully incorporated.

5. **Combine Ingredients:** Add the cooked sausage (or bacon), chopped spinach, and 1 cup of shredded cheese into the egg mixture. Stir until all ingredients are evenly distributed.

6. **Pour into Baking Dish:** Carefully pour the egg and meat mixture into the prepared baking dish. Make sure to spread it out evenly.

7. **Top with Cheese (Optional):** If you’d like an extra cheesy top, sprinkle a bit more cheese on top of the casserole.

8. **Bake:** Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the casserole is puffed up and the edges are starting to turn golden brown. A toothpick should come out clean when inserted in the center.

9. **Cool and Cut:** Once done, remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool slightly. Cut it into squares.

10. **Store and Reheat:** Divide the casserole into meal prep containers. These can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. To reheat, simply microwave a portion until warmed through.

This Keto Breakfast Casserole pairs well with sliced avocado or a side of low-carb berries if you're looking for a little extra freshness.

Query: I don't like vegetables but I want to eat healthy
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for **Lemon Garlic Grilled Chicken** that is healthy and packed with flavor, but does not include any vegetables. This dish can be served with a side of rice or potatoes, making it a complete meal. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade**: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. This mixture will act as both a marinade and a basting sauce for your chicken.

2. **Marinate the Chicken**: Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it is well coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour. If you can marinate it longer (up to 4 hours), the flavors will deepen.

3. **Preheat the Grill**: If you’re using an outdoor grill, heat it to medium-high. If you're using a grill pan on the stovetop, place it over medium heat and add a little drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking.

4. **Grill the Chicken**: Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting any excess drip off. Place the chicken on the hot grill or grill pan. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side without moving it to develop nice grill marks.

5. **Flip the Chicken**: Once browned, flip the chicken breasts over. Using a brush, baste the top side with some of the reserved marinade. Cook for another 6-7 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). This will ensure that the chicken is cooked through and juicy.

6. **Rest the Chicken**: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest on a plate for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a moist bite.

7. **Serve**: Slice the chicken if desired and garnish with fresh parsley for presentation. Serve the grilled chicken alongside a simple portion of rice or mashed potatoes for a fulfilling meal.

Query: Gluten-light recipe - I'm not celiac just sensitive
Dietary Restriction: gluten-free
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here's a delicious and gluten-light recipe for **Quinoa and Spinach Stuffed Bell Peppers**. This dish is vibrant, nutritious, and perfect for two servings.

### Quinoa and Spinach Stuffed Bell Peppers

#### Ingredients:
- 2 medium-sized bell peppers (any color)
- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed
- 2 cups vegetable broth (or water)
- 2 cups fresh spinach, roughly chopped
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup shredded cheese (optional, choose your favorite; for a lighter option, you can use feta)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Prepare the Quinoa:**
   In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth (or water) to a boil. Add the rinsed quinoa, a pinch of salt, and stir. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. **Sauté the Vegetables:**
   While the quinoa is cooking, heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until the onion becomes translucent (about 3-5 minutes). Stir in the chopped spinach and continue to cook until the spinach wilts, which will take about 2 minutes.

4. **Combine the Filling:**
   In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, sautéed onion, garlic, and spinach. Add the dried oregano, paprika, salt, and pepper to taste. If you're using cheese, mix half of it into the filling and reserve the rest for topping.

5. **Prepare the Bell Peppers:**
   While you’re mixing the filling, cut the tops off the bell peppers and remove the seeds. You can keep the tops for decoration if you like, or chop them for another use.

6. **Stuff the Peppers:**
   Spoon the quinoa mixture into each bell pepper, packing it lightly but not too tightly. Place the stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish.

7. **Bake:**
   If using, sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of each stuffed pepper. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to retain moisture and bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

8. **Serve:**
   Carefully remove the stuffed peppers from the oven and let them cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm, garnished with fresh herbs if desired. 

#### Serving Size:
This recipe serves 2 people, with each person getting one stuffed pepper.

Query: Halal BBQ recipe for summer
Dietary Restriction: halal
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious recipe for **Halal Grilled Chicken Skewers** that’s perfect for summer BBQs. This recipe will serve 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice (freshly squeezed)
- 1 tablespoon garlic (minced)
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- Wooden skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes, if using)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Chicken**:
   - Start by cutting the chicken breasts into 1-inch cubes. This size allows for quick and even cooking on the grill.

2. **Marinate the Chicken**:
   - In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, ground coriander, salt, and black pepper. Whisk the ingredients together until well combined.
   - Add the chicken cubes to the marinade and toss until all the pieces are well-coated. 
   - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the chicken to a sealed bag. Let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, or longer if you have time. This will enhance the flavor and tenderness.

3. **Prepare the Skewers**:
   - If you are using wooden skewers, make sure they have been soaked in water for 30 minutes to prevent burning on the grill. You can also use metal skewers, which don’t require soaking.
   - After marinating, thread the marinated chicken pieces onto the skewers. Ensure they are packed tightly but not overcrowded.

4. **Preheat the Grill**:
   - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using a charcoal grill, allow the coals to turn gray and ashy.

5. **Grill the Skewers**:
   - Once the grill is hot, lightly oil the grill grates to prevent sticking. Place the chicken skewers on the grill.
   - Grill the chicken skewers for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has nice grill marks. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).

6. **Serve**:
   - Once cooked, remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute within the chicken.
   - Serve the skewers with a side of grilled vegetables or a fresh salad, and perhaps a drizzle of tahini sauce or garlic yogurt for an extra layer of flavor.

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Zucchini Noodles:**

2. **Make the Meatballs:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, almond flour, chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). 
   - Form the mixture into balls, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
   - Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until they are cooked through and browned on the outside.

   - While the meatballs are baking, heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds, being careful not to burn it.
   - Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried basil, and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Cook the Zucchini Noodles:**

5. **Combine and Serve:**
   - Once the meatballs are done baking, add them to the saucepan with the marinara sauce, gently stirring to coat each meatball.
   - Divide the zucchini noodles between two plates and top with the meatballs and sauce mixture.

1. **Prepare the Zucchini Noodles:**
   - Use a spiralizer or a vegetable peeler to create zucchini noodles. Set aside. If you don’t have a spiralizer, peel the zucchini into long strips. Sprinkle with a little salt to help draw out excess moisture.

2. **Make the Meatballs:**
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, almond flour, chopped onion, minced garlic, egg, Italian seasoning, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly incorporated.
   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). 
   - Form the mixture into balls, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter, and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
   - Bake the meatballs in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until they are cooked through and browned on the outside.

3. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - While the meatballs are baking, heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add minced garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds, being careful not to burn it.
   - Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried basil, and dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Cook the Zucchini Noodles:**
   - In a large skillet, heat a small amount of olive oil over medium heat. Add the zucchini noodles and cook for about 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they are just tender but still al dente. Do not overcook, as they can become mushy. 

5. **Combine and Serve:**
   - Once the meatballs are done baking, add them to the saucepan with the marinara sauce, gently stirring to coat each meatball.
   - Divide the zucchini noodles between two plates and top with the meatballs and sauce mixture.
   - Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, and enjoy your healthy and delicious Paleo spaghetti and meatballs!

Query: Diabetic-friendly dessert that doesn't use artificial sweeteners
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Here’s a delightful diabetic-friendly dessert recipe for **Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies**. This recipe uses wholesome ingredients and avoids artificial sweeteners while still being delicious!

### Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies

**Servings:** 2 (approximately 4 cookies)

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (melted) or unsalted butter
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (preferably 70% cacao or higher)
- Optional: 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon for added flavor

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cookies from sticking.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, baking soda, sea salt, and cinnamon (if using). Whisk together until they are well blended. The almond flour adds a nutty flavor, and the baking soda will help the cookies rise slightly.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, mix together the melted coconut oil (or butter), egg, and vanilla extract. Stir thoroughly until the mixture is smooth. The oil should be warm but not too hot, as you don't want to cook the egg.

4. **Combine Mixtures:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined, making sure not to overmix. The dough will be moist and slightly sticky.

5. **Fold in Chocolate Chips:** Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips. These will add sweetness and rich flavor to your cookies. 

6. **Scoop the Dough:** Using a tablespoon or a cookie scoop, drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Leave enough space between each cookie, as they may spread a little while baking. Aim for about 2 to 3 inches apart.

7. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly underbaked, but they will firm up as they cool.

8. **Cool:** Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. **Serve and Enjoy:** Once cooled, enjoy these cookies as a tasty, diabetic-friendly dessert! They pair beautifully with a cup of herbal tea or a glass of almond milk.

These cookies store well in an airtight container at room temperature and can last for a week. Enjoy your delicious and healthy dessert!

Query: I'm dairy-free but pregnant and craving ice cream constantly
Dietary Restriction: dairy-free
Recipe Response: I have just the recipe for you! Let’s make a delicious Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream. It’s a creamy, satisfying treat that’s perfect for your ice cream cravings, and it’s quick and easy to prepare.

### Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 ripe bananas
- 1 tablespoon of almond milk (or any dairy-free milk of your choice)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- A pinch of sea salt
- Optional toppings: chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, fresh fruit, or a drizzle of nut butter

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Bananas:**
   - Start by peeling the ripe bananas and slicing them into small rounds. The riper the bananas, the sweeter and creamier your nice cream will be.

2. **Freeze the Bananas:**
   - Place the banana slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze them for about 1-2 hours, or until they are completely solid. This step is crucial for achieving that ice cream-like consistency.

3. **Blend the Ingredients:**
   - Once the banana slices are frozen, remove them from the freezer and place them into a high-speed blender or food processor. Add the almond milk, vanilla extract (if using), and a pinch of sea salt for flavor.

4. **Blend Till Smooth:**
   - Blend the mixture on high until it becomes creamy and smooth. You may need to pause and scrape down the sides of the blender or processor a couple of times to ensure everything is evenly blended. This should take about 1-2 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little more almond milk to reach your desired consistency.

5. **Taste and Adjust:**
   - Give your nice cream a taste. If you want it sweeter, you can add a little maple syrup or honey (if not strictly vegan) and blend again.

6. **Serve:**
   - Scoop the nice cream into two bowls. If desired, top with your choice of toppings such as chopped nuts, dairy-free chocolate chips, fresh fruit, or a drizzle of nut butter.

7. **Enjoy Immediately:**
   - This nice cream is best enjoyed right away while it's soft and creamy, but you can also transfer any leftovers to a container and freeze them for up to a week. Just let it soften a bit on the counter before serving later.

This Dairy-Free Banana Nice Cream is not only delicious but also full of nutrients from the bananas. Enjoy your healthy treat!

Query: I don't like vegetables but I want to eat healthy
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for you that’s not vegetable-heavy but still healthy: **Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken**. This dish is packed with flavor and is a great source of protein. It serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Juice of 1 lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: Fresh herbs for garnish (like parsley or basil)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Marinade**: In a mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, dried thyme, salt, and pepper. Whisk until well combined. This marinade will impart great flavor while keeping the chicken moist.

2. **Marinate the Chicken**: Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring all sides are coated. Seal the bag or cover the dish and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. For even better flavor, marinate for up to 2 hours.

3. **Preheat the Grill**: If you're using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat (about 375°F to 400°F). If using a grill pan on the stove, heat it over medium heat and lightly oil it to prevent sticking.

4. **Grill the Chicken**: Remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing excess marinade to drip off. Place the chicken breasts on the grill or grill pan. Cook for about 6-7 minutes on one side, or until you see nice grill marks.

5. **Flip and Finish Cooking**: Flip the chicken breasts and cook for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C). The chicken should be golden brown with a juicy center.

6. **Rest the Chicken**: Once cooked, remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest on a plate for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the chicken more tender.

7. **Serve**: Slice the grilled chicken and serve it with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and garnish with fresh herbs if desired. You could pair this with a simple side like brown rice or quinoa for a complete meal.

Query: Raw vegan soup that's actually warm somehow?
Dietary Restriction: raw vegan
Recipe Response: Certainly! Here’s a delightful recipe for a Raw Vegan Warm Soup that utilizes the warmth of spices and a few clever techniques to create a comforting bowl without any cooking involved.

### Raw Vegan Spiced Tomato and Basil Soup

#### Serving Size:
2 people

#### Ingredients:
- 4 large ripe tomatoes
- 1 medium red bell pepper
- 1 small cucumber
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon sea salt (adjust to taste)
- A handful of fresh basil leaves
- 1 cup of filtered water (adjust for desired consistency)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Vegetables**: Start by washing the tomatoes, bell pepper, and cucumber under cold water. Cut the tomatoes into quarters and remove the seeds if you wish for a smoother texture. Chop the red bell pepper into large pieces and the cucumber into chunks.

2. **Blend the Base**: In a high-speed blender, combine the chopped tomatoes, red bell pepper, and cucumber. This combination forms the vibrant base of your soup. 

3. **Add Aromatics and Spice**: Next, add the garlic clove (peeled), olive oil, fresh ginger, smoked paprika, dried oregano, and sea salt to the blender. 

4. **Blend Until Smooth**: Blend on high until the mixture is completely smooth. This should take about 1-2 minutes. The friction from the blades will gently warm the soup, making it feel cozy and comforting without cooking.

5. **Incorporate Fresh Basil**: Once blended, add the fresh basil leaves to the mixture and pulse the blender just a few times until the basil is roughly chopped but not completely puréed. This will provide beautiful flecks of green in your soup.

6. **Adjust Consistency**: If you prefer a thinner soup, slowly add in the filtered water while blending until you reach your desired consistency. 

7. **Taste and Adjust Seasoning**: Grab a spoon and taste your soup! You can adjust the seasoning by adding more salt or spices according to your preference.

8. **Serve Warm**: Pour the soup into bowls and allow it to sit for a minute, as the blending process will have warmed it slightly. If you’d like it a tad warmer, you can briefly blend it again for a few seconds while holding the lid tightly.

9. **Garnish and Enjoy**: Optionally, you can garnish the soup with a few whole basil leaves or a drizzle of olive oil before serving. Enjoy your warm raw vegan tomato and basil soup!

Enjoy your deliciously unique soup experience!

9. **Garnish and Enjoy**: Optionally, you can garnish the soup with a few whole basil leaves or a drizzle of olive oil before serving. Enjoy your warm raw vegan tomato and basil soup!

Recipe Response: **Recipe: Avocado Chocolate Mousse**

*Serving Size: 2 people*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 ripe avocado
- 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup (adjust based on your sweetness preference)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt
- Optional toppings: whipped coconut cream, berries, or chopped nuts

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Avocado:** Start by cutting the ripe avocado in half. Remove the pit and scoop the flesh into a blender or food processor. Ripe avocados will lend a creamy texture that is perfect for mousse.

2. **Add the Sweetness:** Add the unsweetened cocoa powder, honey (or maple syrup), vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to the avocado in the blender. The salt will enhance the flavors and balance the sweetness.

3. **Blend it Up:** Blend the mixture on high until everything is fully combined and the texture is smooth and creamy. You may need to stop and scrape down the sides of the blender a couple of times to ensure all ingredients are well incorporated.

4. **Taste and Adjust:** Once blended, taste the mousse. If you prefer it sweeter, add a bit more honey or maple syrup and blend again until combined.

5. **Chill the Mousse:** Spoon the chocolate mousse into two serving bowls or dessert cups. Cover them with plastic wrap or foil and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the mousse to set a bit.

6. **Serve:** Once chilled, you can top your mousse with a dollop of whipped coconut cream, a handful of fresh berries, or a sprinkle of chopped nuts for added texture and flavor. 

7. **Enjoy:** Your creamy, decadent avocado chocolate mousse is ready to serve. Dive in and enjoy a dessert that feels indulgent but is packed with healthy ingredients!

This dessert will surprise you with its rich chocolate flavor while being a delightful healthy option!
