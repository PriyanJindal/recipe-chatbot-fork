Query: Raw vegan salad that doesn't taste like grass
Dietary Restriction: raw vegan
Recipe Response: **Crispy Apple and Beet Salad**

This refreshing raw vegan salad combines crunchy apples and earthy beets with a tangy dressing that masks any ""grass"" flavor, making it a delightful dish perfect for a light meal or side. 

**Serving Size:** 2 people

### Ingredients:
- 1 medium beet, peeled and grated
- 1 medium apple (such as a Fuji or Honeycrisp), cored and thinly sliced
- 1 cup of shredded carrots
- 1/4 cup of walnuts, roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon of olive oil
- 1 teaspoon of maple syrup (optional, for sweetness)
- Salt and pepper, to taste

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Ingredients:**
   Start by peeling the beetroot and grating it using a box grater or food processor. Do this over a large bowl to catch any juices. Then, core the apple and slice it into thin wedges or matchsticks to add a nice crunch to the salad. Finally, shred the carrots using the same method.

2. **Combine the Veggies:**
   In the large bowl containing the grated beet, add the shredded carrots and sliced apple. Gently toss them together so that the colors mix beautifully. The apple will add a hint of sweetness that balances the earthiness of the beet.

3. **Make the Dressing:**

4. **Add the Walnuts:**
   Roughly chop the walnuts and add them to the vegetable mixture. The walnuts will introduce a delightful crunch and healthy fats to the dish.

5. **Dress the Salad:**
   Pour the dressing over the salad mixture. Toss everything gently to ensure that the dressing coats all the ingredients evenly. This step not only enhances the flavors but also gives the salad a beautiful sheen.

6. **Garnish and Serve:**
   Optionally, chop some parsley or mint leaves for garnish and sprinkle them over the top. These herbs will add a burst of freshness that complements the salad nicely. 

7. **Enjoy:**
   Serve the salad immediately for the best texture, or let it sit for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Enjoy this colorful salad as a nutritious lunch or a refreshing side dish!

Query: Diabetic-friendly dessert that doesn't use artificial sweeteners
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: **Recipe: Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies**

This deliciously chewy dessert is perfect for two and filled with flavor without the need for artificial sweeteners. Using almond flour keeps the carbs low while still being delightful!

**Servings:** 2 (Makes about 6 cookies)

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (melted and cooled slightly)
- 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup (natural sweeteners)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (semisweet or unsweetened, choose a lower-sugar variety if desired)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat Your Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a small mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Whisk them together until thoroughly mixed, ensuring there are no clumps.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, mix the melted coconut oil, honey (or maple syrup), and vanilla extract. Stir well until the mixture is smooth and combined. Make sure the coconut oil isn’t too hot to prevent cooking the honey.

4. **Combine Mixtures:** Gradually add the dry mixture into the wet mixture, stirring until a dough forms. The dough may be a little sticky, which is perfect! Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

5. **Form Cookies:** Scoop a tablespoon of dough and roll it into a ball, placing it on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat this, ensuring to leave enough space between each ball as they will spread while baking. Press each dough ball slightly flat with your fingers or the bottom of a glass.

6. **Bake:** Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them as cookies can bake quickly.

7. **Cool:** Once baked, remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. **Enjoy:** Serve these nutritious cookies warm or at room temperature. They are delightful on their own or paired with a cup of herbal tea or coffee.

**Storage:** Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Query: Gluten-free pizza dough that actually tastes good and isn't cardboard
Dietary Restriction: gluten-free
Recipe Response: Here's a delightful gluten-free pizza dough recipe that’s both tasty and easy to make, serving 2 people. This dough has a great texture and won't leave you feeling like you're chewing on cardboard!

### Gluten-Free Pizza Dough Recipe

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour (ensure it contains xanthan gum)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/3 cup warm water (about 110°F or 43°C)
- 1 teaspoon honey or sugar (optional for slight sweetness; can be omitted)
- Optional: Italian herbs (like oregano or basil) for added flavor

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare Your Workspace:**
   Begin by gathering all your ingredients and preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up; otherwise, a baking sheet will work fine.

2. **Mix the Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium bowl, whisk together the gluten-free all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and, if you choose, a pinch of Italian herbs to infuse some additional flavor.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   In a separate small bowl, combine the warm water, olive oil, and honey (if using). Stir the mixture gently until the honey is dissolved.

4. **Create the Dough:**
   Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl containing the dry ingredients. Using a spatula or your hands, mix everything together until it forms a cohesive dough. The dough will be a bit sticky but should hold together well. If it’s too wet, you can add a bit more flour, one tablespoon at a time.

5. **Shape the Dough:**
   On a clean, floured surface (using gluten-free flour), place the dough and gently shape it into a round ball. Then, flatten it out with your hands or a rolling pin to form your pizza crust, about 1/4 inch thick. Use your fingers to create a slight lip around the edge for the crust.

6. **Pre-Bake the Crust:**
   Transfer the crust carefully to a parchment-lined baking sheet or onto your preheated pizza stone. Bake it in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. This pre-baking step helps set the dough and gives it a firmer texture.

7. **Add Toppings:**
   After 10 minutes, remove the crust from the oven. Now is the time to add your toppings of choice! Tomato sauce, cheese, vegetables, meats – whatever you fancy!

8. **Bake the Pizza:**
   Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbling and golden, and the crust has a nice golden-brown color.

9. **Serve and Enjoy:**
   Once baked, take the pizza out of the oven and let it cool slightly. Slice it up and enjoy your delicious gluten-free pizza!

### Serving Size:
This recipe yields two personal-sized pizzas, perfect for a cozy dinner for two.

Query: I'm diabetic but I want to make a fruit cake for Christmas. My grandmother's recipe has tons of sugar and dried fruit but it's tradition and I can't just skip it this year. Is there any way to modify it so I can still participate in the family tradition without spiking my blood sugar?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Absolutely! You can create a delicious diabetic-friendly fruit cake that still honors your family tradition while being mindful of your blood sugar levels. Here’s a modified recipe that uses natural sweetness and lower sugar alternatives.

### Diabetic-Friendly Fruit Cake

**Serving Size:** 2 people

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup mixed unsweetened dried fruit (such as unsweetened apricots, dates, and cranberries—be wary of portions)
- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans work well)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Zest of 1 orange or lemon
- Optional: 1 tablespoon sugar-free maple syrup or honey for added sweetness

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a small loaf pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal after baking.

2. **Prepare the Fruit**: If you're using dried fruit, chop them into small pieces. This helps distribute them evenly throughout the cake. You can also soak the dried fruit in warm water for about 10 minutes to soften them if desired.

3. **Combine the Dry Ingredients**: In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, almond flour, baking powder, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and salt. Whisk these ingredients together until well mixed.

4. **Mix the Wet Ingredients**: In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, unsweetened applesauce, vanilla extract, and zest from the orange or lemon. If you’re using sugar-free maple syrup or honey, add it at this stage as well.

5. **Combine Both Mixtures**: Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, stirring gently until combined. Be careful not to overmix. Finally, fold in the chopped nuts and the dried fruit.

6. **Pour Into the Pan**: Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread it out evenly. Smooth the top with a spatula.

7. **Bake**: Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 35-40 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Be sure to keep an eye on it; the edges should be a light golden brown.

8. **Cool and Serve**: After baking, let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, slice and enjoy!

This cake can be served fresh or stored in an airtight container for a few days. You can even drizzle a bit of sugar-free icing on top if you want a special touch. This recipe keeps the festive spirit alive while accommodating your dietary needs!

Query: Need a quick gluten-free breakfast. I hate eggs though.
Dietary Restriction: gluten-free
Recipe Response: Here's a delicious recipe for **Gluten-Free Banana Oatmeal Pancakes** that serves 2 people. These fluffy pancakes are easy to make and require no eggs!

### Ingredients:
- 1 cup gluten-free rolled oats
- 1 medium ripe banana
- 1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)
- 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup (optional for sweetness)
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)
- Pinch of salt
- Cooking oil or butter (for the skillet)

### Instructions:

1. **Blend the Oats:**
   Start by placing the gluten-free rolled oats in a blender or food processor. Blend until they resemble a fine flour. This will take about 30 seconds to a minute.

2. **Combine Ingredients:**
   In the blender with the oat flour, add the ripe banana, milk, honey or maple syrup (if using), baking powder, ground cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Blend everything together until the mixture is smooth and well combined. The batter should be thick but pourable. If it’s too thick, add a little more milk until you reach the desired consistency.

   Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Once hot, add a little cooking oil or butter to coat the surface.

4. **Cook the Pancakes:**
   Pour about ¼ cup of pancake batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface (about 2-3 minutes). Carefully flip the pancakes and cook on the other side for another 1-2 minutes, until they are golden brown.

5. **Repeat:**
   Repeat this process with the remaining batter, adding more oil to the skillet as necessary. You should be able to make about 4-6 pancakes, depending on the size.

6. **Serve:**
   Serve the pancakes hot, topped with your favorite toppings such as fresh fruits, a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, nut butter, or yogurt.

FAIL,"The recipe response attempts to modify a traditional fruit cake to be more diabetic-friendly by reducing sugar content and using a sugar substitute. However, there are several concerns that make it not fully suitable for a diabetic-friendly label. Firstly, the use of whole wheat flour can still contribute to a higher glycemic index compared to other low-carb flour alternatives like almond or coconut flour. Secondly, the inclusion of honey, even in a reduced amount, is not ideal for a diabetic-friendly recipe due to its high sugar content. Although a sugar substitute is suggested, the equivalence to honey is not clearly defined, which could lead to improper substitution. Additionally, the use of dried fruits, even low-sugar options, can still contribute significant carbohydrates and sugars, which may affect blood sugar levels. Lastly, the orange juice, while freshly squeezed, still contains natural sugars that could impact blood glucose. Overall, while the recipe makes some adjustments, it does not sufficiently adhere to the diabetic-friendly dietary restriction due to the presence of ingredients that can raise blood sugar levels.","You are an expert nutritionist and dietary specialist.

Query: I want a cheeseburger but I'm dairy-free and vegetarian. I know this sounds impossible but I'm really craving the taste and texture of a classic American cheeseburger and I haven't had one in 3 years since I went vegetarian and developed lactose intolerance
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: I have just the recipe for you! You can make a delicious Vegan Black Bean Cheeseburger that will satisfy your craving for a classic cheeseburger without any dairy or meat. This recipe is not only easy to follow but also packed with flavor. This recipe serves 2.

### Vegan Black Bean Cheeseburger

#### Ingredients:
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, rinsed and drained
- ½ cup breadcrumbs (use gluten-free if required)
- ¼ cup finely chopped onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- ½ tsp smoked paprika
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 slices of dairy-free cheese (such as Daiya or similar)
- 2 whole grain burger buns (check for dairy-free)
- Lettuce leaves
- Tomato slices
- Pickles (optional)
- Ketchup and mustard (or your favorite condiments)

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Black Bean Mixture**: In a large bowl, mash the black beans using a fork or a potato masher. You want to have a mixture that is mostly smooth but still has some chunky bits for texture.

2. **Add Vegetables and Spices**: To the mashed black beans, add the chopped onion, minced garlic, ground cumin, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix everything together until well combined.

3. **Incorporate the Breadcrumbs**: Gradually add the breadcrumbs to the mixture. This will help bind the patties and give them a firmer texture. You want a consistency that’s moldable; feel free to adjust the amount of breadcrumbs as necessary.

4. **Shape the Patties**: Divide the mixture into 2 equal portions and shape them into patties (about ¾ inch thick). Ensure they are compact so they hold together during cooking.

5. **Cook the Patties**: Heat a non-stick skillet or grilling pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with a splash of vegetable oil. Place the patties on the skillet and cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and heated through. If you’d like, add the slices of dairy-free cheese to the patties during the last minute of cooking, covering the skillet with a lid to help the cheese melt.

6. **Toast the Buns**: While the patties are cooking, you can toast the burger buns in a separate skillet or under the broiler for a minute or two, until slightly golden and crisp.

7. **Assemble Your Burgers**: Place the cooked black bean patties onto the bottom halves of the toasted burger buns. Top each with lettuce, tomato slices, pickles (if using), and your favorite condiments. Finish with the top half of the bun.

8. **Serve and Enjoy**: Serve your vegan black bean cheeseburgers immediately with a side of crispy baked fries or a fresh salad if desired. 

These burgers are not only reminiscent of traditional cheeseburgers but are also healthy and filled with flavor. Enjoy your meal!

3. **Incorporate the Breadcrumbs**: Gradually add the breadcrumbs to the mixture. This will help bind the patties and give them a firmer texture. You want a consistency that’s moldable; feel free to adjust the amount of breadcrumbs as necessary.

4. **Shape the Patties**: Divide the mixture into 2 equal portions and shape them into patties (about ¾ inch thick). Ensure they are compact so they hold together during cooking.

5. **Cook the Patties**: Heat a non-stick skillet or grilling pan over medium heat and lightly grease it with a splash of vegetable oil. Place the patties on the skillet and cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and heated through. If you’d like, add the slices of dairy-free cheese to the patties during the last minute of cooking, covering the skillet with a lid to help the cheese melt.

6. **Toast the Buns**: While the patties are cooking, you can toast the burger buns in a separate skillet or under the broiler for a minute or two, until slightly golden and crisp.

7. **Assemble Your Burgers**: Place the cooked black bean patties onto the bottom halves of the toasted burger buns. Top each with lettuce, tomato slices, pickles (if using), and your favorite condiments. Finish with the top half of the bun.

8. **Serve and Enjoy**: Serve your vegan black bean cheeseburgers immediately with a side of crispy baked fries or a fresh salad if desired. 

These burgers are not only reminiscent of traditional cheeseburgers but are also healthy and filled with flavor. Enjoy your meal!",CHAIN,True,I want a cheeseburger but I'm dairy-free and vegetarian.

Query: Whole30 compliant dinner that my non-Whole30 husband will actually eat
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: I have a great recipe for **Honey Garlic Chicken with Roasted Vegetables** that is Whole30 compliant and delicious enough that your husband will enjoy too. This dish is flavorful and satisfying, perfect for dinner for two!

### Honey Garlic Chicken with Roasted Vegetables

#### Servings:
2

#### Ingredients:
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons coconut aminos (as a substitute for soy sauce)
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon fresh minced garlic (about 2 cloves)
- 1 tablespoon honey (note: this is only compliant in the context of a Whole30 reset, but can be omitted or reduced)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 cups mixed vegetables (like broccoli, bell peppers, and carrots)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Optional: fresh chopped parsley, for garnish

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 425°F (220°C). This high temperature will help roast the vegetables to perfection.

2. **Prepare the Chicken Marinade**: In a small bowl, mix together the coconut aminos, apple cider vinegar, minced garlic, and honey (if using). Taste the marinade and adjust with salt and pepper as necessary.

3. **Marinate the Chicken**: Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or a resealable bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, making sure to coat it well. Let it marinate while you prepare the vegetables, about 15-20 minutes. This helps to infuse flavor into the chicken.

4. **Prepare the Vegetables**: In a mixing bowl, toss your mixed vegetables with olive oil, seasoning them with salt and pepper to taste. Ensure they are evenly coated.

5. **Roast the Vegetables**: Spread the seasoned vegetables evenly on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Roast in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes.

6. **Cook the Chicken**: While the vegetables are roasting, heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade (discard the leftover marinade) and add it to the hot skillet. Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the chicken is fully cooked through and has a nice golden-brown color. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).

7. **Finish Roasting the Vegetables**: After the chicken is cooked, check the vegetables. They should be getting tender and slightly caramelized. If they need a little more time, leave them in the oven for another 5-10 minutes.

8. **Plating**: Once everything is cooked, take the chicken and vegetables out of the oven. Let the chicken rest for a couple of minutes before slicing it. Plate the chicken alongside the roasted vegetables for a beautiful presentation.

9. **Garnish and Serve**: If desired, sprinkle some fresh chopped parsley over the dish for an added touch of freshness. Serve hot and enjoy!

### Tips:
- If you want to add some spice, feel free to include red pepper flakes or a dash of sriracha (check that it’s Whole30 compliant).
- This recipe pairs beautifully with a side of cauliflower rice for a more filling meal without deviating from Whole30 guidelines.

Enjoy your delightful and wholesome dinner!

Query: Low-carb pasta substitute that my Italian grandmother won't disown me for
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: I have a delightful recipe for Zucchini Noodles with Pesto that will not only satisfy your pasta cravings but also impress your Italian grandmother! This dish is low in carbs, yet rich in flavor and freshness, making it a perfect alternative. This recipe serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:
- 2 medium zucchinis
- 1 cup fresh basil leaves
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (or nutritional yeast for a vegan option)
- 1/4 cup pine nuts (or walnuts)
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cherry tomatoes (optional, for garnish)

### Instructions:

1. **Make the Zucchini Noodles (Zoodles)**:
   - Start by washing the zucchinis thoroughly. Use a vegetable peeler or a spiralizer to create noodle shapes from the zucchinis. If you're using a peeler, peel the zucchini into long strips; if using a spiralizer, just spiralize until you reach the seeds in the center. 
   - Once you’ve got your zoodles, place them into a colander, sprinkle with a little salt, and let them sit for about 10 minutes to remove excess moisture. This step helps prevent the dish from becoming watery.

2. **Prepare the Pesto**:
   - While the zoodles are draining, prepare the pesto. In a food processor, combine the basil leaves, grated Parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and garlic cloves. Pulse until the mixture is finely chopped.
   - With the food processor running, slowly add the olive oil until the pesto is smooth and creamy. You may need to scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. **Cook the Zoodles**:
   - Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the drained zoodles and sauté for about 2-3 minutes until they are tender but still have a slight crunch. Be careful not to overcook, as you want to maintain some firmness.
   - Remove the skillet from heat.

4. **Combine and Serve**:
   - In a large bowl, toss the cooked zoodles with the pesto until they are well coated. You can adjust the amount of pesto to your liking—add more if you prefer a richer flavor.
   - Serve immediately, garnished with halved cherry tomatoes and an extra sprinkle of Parmesan cheese if desired.

FAIL,"The recipe response attempts to create a diabetic-friendly fruit cake by using natural sweeteners and reducing the amount of dried fruits. However, it includes honey or maple syrup as a sweetener, which are both high in sugar and can significantly impact blood sugar levels. Additionally, the use of whole wheat flour, while healthier than refined flour, still contains carbohydrates that can affect blood sugar. The inclusion of unsweetened dried fruits, even in moderation, can also contribute to a higher glycemic load.

Query: I'm diabetic but I want to make a fruit cake for Christmas. My grandmother's recipe has tons of sugar and dried fruit but it's tradition and I can't just skip it this year. Is there any way to modify it so I can still participate in the family tradition without spiking my blood sugar?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Certainly! You can create a diabetic-friendly fruit cake that captures the essence of traditional flavors while minimizing sugar. Here’s a recipe for a healthier fruit cake that uses natural sweeteners and a variety of nuts and dried fruits in moderation. 

### Diabetic-Friendly Fruit Cake Recipe

**Serving Size:** 2 people

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup mixed nuts (walnuts, almonds, pecans) chopped
- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/4 cup honey or maple syrup (adjust based on preferences)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 cup chopped unsweetened dried fruits (like apricots, cranberries, or raisins) - aim for lower sugar options
- 1/2 cup grated carrots (optional for moisture and flavor)
- Zest of 1 orange or lemon (for added flavor)
- A pinch of salt
- Optional: 1 tsp vanilla extract

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat Your Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease a small loaf pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal later.

2. **Mix the Wet Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the applesauce, honey (or maple syrup), and eggs. Whisk them together until you have a smooth mixture. If you are using vanilla extract, add it in at this stage.

3. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In another bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, baking powder, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and salt. Stir until well combined.

4. **Incorporate the Nuts and Dried Fruits:** Add the chopped nuts and the dried fruits to the flour mixture. Mix them together to ensure that the fruits and nuts are evenly distributed in the flour. This will help prevent them from sinking to the bottom of the cake during baking.

5. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture into the wet ingredients, stirring gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cake dense. If you’re using grated carrots and zest, fold them in gently at this point.

6. **Pour into the Baking Pan:** Transfer the batter into your prepared loaf pan, smoothing the top with a spatula to level it out.

7. **Bake:** Place the loaf pan in your preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

8. **Cool the Cake:** Once done, take the cake out of the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then carefully remove it from the pan and let it cool completely on a wire rack.

9. **Serve:** Once cooled, slice the cake and enjoy! This fruit cake can be stored in an airtight container for up to a week.

Query: Vegetarian curry but I don't eat onions or garlic for religious reasons
Dietary Restriction: vegetarian
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious recipe for a **Vegetarian Coconut Chickpea Curry** that is onion and garlic-free, perfect for two servings.

### Ingredients:
- 1 can (15 oz) coconut milk
- 1 can (15 oz) chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 1 medium-sized tomato, chopped
- 1 cup spinach (fresh or frozen)
- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated (fresh or jarred)
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cooked rice or naan for serving (optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Ingredients**: Begin by gathering your ingredients. Have your chickpeas rinsed and drained, coconut milk ready, and the spinach washed (if fresh).

2. **Sauté the Ginger**: In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the grated ginger and sauté for about 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.

3. **Add Spices**: Sprinkle the curry powder and turmeric into the pan with the ginger, stirring constantly for about 30 seconds. This helps to release the spices' flavors and aroma, making your curry more vibrant.

4. **Incorporate the Tomato**: Add the chopped tomato to the pan. Stir well and cook for another 3-4 minutes until the tomatoes soften and begin to break down.

5. **Add Coconut Milk & Chickpeas**: Pour in the can of coconut milk and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Next, add in the chickpeas, mixing to ensure they're evenly distributed in the sauce.

6. **Simmer the Curry**: Let the curry simmer on low heat for about 10-15 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together beautifully. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.

7. **Add Spinach**: In the last few minutes of cooking, add the spinach. If using fresh spinach, it will wilt quickly. Stir it into the curry and cook just until it’s heated through, about 2-3 minutes.

8. **Season**: Taste your curry and add salt and pepper as needed. Depending on personal preference, you can adjust the seasoning to your liking.

9. **Serve**: Once your curry is creamy and fragrant, remove it from the heat. Serve it hot over cooked rice or with warm naan. Enjoy your hearty, flavorful Vegetarian Coconut Chickpea Curry!

- 1/4 cup shredded coconut (unsweetened)
- 1/4 teaspoon sea salt

Query: I'm diabetic but I want to make a fruit cake for Christmas. My grandmother's recipe has tons of sugar and dried fruit but it's tradition and I can't just skip it this year. Is there any way to modify it so I can still participate in the family tradition without spiking my blood sugar?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Absolutely! You can make a delicious sugar-free fruit cake that still honors your grandmother's recipe while being mindful of your diabetes. Here’s a modified recipe that serves 2 people, perfect for you to join in the festive spirit without compromising your health.

**Sugar-Free Fruit Cake**

**Ingredients:**

- 1 cup mixed nuts (walnuts, almonds, pecans), roughly chopped
- 1/2 cup unsweetened dried fruit (such as raisins, cranberries, or apricots), chopped finely
- 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/4 cup almond flour
- 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (optional, for richness)
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- A pinch of salt
- Optional: Zest of one lemon or orange for added flavor

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat Your Oven:** Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a small loaf pan (around 5x7 inches) with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent sticking.

2. **Prepare Your Dry Ingredients:** In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, whole wheat flour, baking powder, ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and cocoa powder (if using). Whisk everything together until well mixed. This will ensure an even distribution of the baking powder and spices.

3. **Mix the Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, unsweetened applesauce, and vanilla extract. Stir in the lemon or orange zest if you’re using it – this adds a lovely bright flavor to your cake.

4. **Combine Mixtures:** Slowly add the wet ingredients into the dry mixture. Stir gently with a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the cake dense.

5. **Fold in the Nuts and Dried Fruit:** Gently fold the chopped nuts and dried fruit into the batter. Make sure they are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

6. **Transfer to Loaf Pan:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread it out evenly. Tap it lightly on the counter to remove any air bubbles.

7. **Bake the Cake:** Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The edges should be lightly golden, and the top should feel firm to the touch.

8. **Cool before Serving:** Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. This allows the flavors to develop further.

9. **Slice & Enjoy:** Slice the fruit cake once it's completely cooled, letting each person enjoy a slice that fits well into their dietary needs. Enjoy it plain, with a light smear of cream cheese, or even a dollop of Greek yogurt for extra indulgence.

This sugar-free fruit cake allows you to embrace the festive flavors without the sugar overload, keeping it in line with your dietary requirements. Enjoy making memories this Christmas with a treat everyone can enjoy!

Query: Whole30 compliant dinner that my non-Whole30 husband will actually eat
Dietary Restriction: whole30
Recipe Response: I have a delicious recipe for **Lemon Garlic Herb Chicken with Roasted Vegetables** that is Whole30 compliant and sure to please even the pickiest of eaters. This meal serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:

**For the Chicken:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste

**For the Roasted Vegetables:**
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup baby carrots or sliced regular carrots
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: ½ teaspoon paprika for extra flavor

### Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.
   - Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is well-coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator for best results.

2. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). This high temperature will help to roast the vegetables and cook the chicken perfectly.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - While the chicken is marinating, prepare the vegetables. In a large bowl, combine the broccoli, red bell pepper, and carrots.
   - Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and paprika (if using). Toss everything together until the vegetables are well-coated in oil and seasonings.

4. **Roast the Vegetables:**
   - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it. Spread the seasoned vegetables in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
   - Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

5. **Cook the Chicken:**
   - While the vegetables are roasting, heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade (discard any leftover marinade) and place them in the hot skillet.
   - Sear the chicken for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. 

6. **Combine and Finish Cooking:**
   - After the vegetables have roasted for 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and make space for the chicken by pushing the vegetables to the sides. Place the seared chicken breasts in the center of the baking sheet.
   - Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C) and the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.

7. **Serve:**
   - Once cooked, remove everything from the oven. Allow the chicken to rest for a couple of minutes before slicing.
   - Plate the chicken alongside the roasted vegetables, drizzling with any juices from the pan if desired.

This flavorful Lemon Garlic Herb Chicken with Roasted Vegetables is not only healthy and compliant with Whole30, but it's also incredibly delicious and should satisfy your husband's palate too. Enjoy your dinner!

This meal serves 2 people.

### Ingredients:

**For the Chicken:**
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Zest of 1 lemon
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper, to taste

**For the Roasted Vegetables:**
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup baby carrots or sliced regular carrots
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- Optional: ½ teaspoon paprika for extra flavor

### Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.
   - Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish or resealable plastic bag and pour the marinade over them. Ensure the chicken is well-coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the refrigerator for best results.

2. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). This high temperature will help to roast the vegetables and cook the chicken perfectly.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - While the chicken is marinating, prepare the vegetables. In a large bowl, combine the broccoli, red bell pepper, and carrots.
   - Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and paprika (if using). Toss everything together until the vegetables are well-coated in oil and seasonings.

4. **Roast the Vegetables:**
   - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it. Spread the seasoned vegetables in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
   - Roast in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

5. **Cook the Chicken:**
   - While the vegetables are roasting, heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade (discard any leftover marinade) and place them in the hot skillet.
   - Sear the chicken for about 4-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. 

6. **Combine and Finish Cooking:**
   - After the vegetables have roasted for 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and make space for the chicken by pushing the vegetables to the sides. Place the seared chicken breasts in the center of the baking sheet.
   - Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C) and the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized.

7. **Serve:**
   - Once cooked, remove everything from the oven. Allow the chicken to rest for a couple of minutes before slicing.
   - Plate the chicken alongside the roasted vegetables, drizzling with any juices from the pan if desired.

Query: Vegan cheese recipe but it should taste good. i can have cashews but no other nuts. i don't like nutritional yeast
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: Absolutely! Here’s a delightful recipe for **Vegan Cashew Cheese** that is both tasty and satisfying. This cheese has a creamy texture with a hint of tanginess, perfect for spreading or using in various dishes.

**Vegan Cashew Cheese**

**Servings:** 2

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup raw cashews (soaked for at least 4 hours, or overnight)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice (freshly squeezed for best flavor)
- 1 garlic clove (minced)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil (extra virgin)
- 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
- Optional: Fresh herbs like chives or parsley for added flavor

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Cashews:** Start by draining and rinsing the soaked cashews. Soaking them softens the nuts, making them easier to blend into a creamy consistency.

2. **Blend the Ingredients:** In a high-speed blender or food processor, combine the soaked cashews, lemon juice, minced garlic, olive oil, apple cider vinegar, salt, and black pepper. If you’re using fresh herbs, you can add them at this stage too.

3. **Blend Until Smooth:** Blend the mixture on high until it becomes completely smooth and creamy. You may need to stop occasionally to scrape down the sides to ensure everything is well mixed. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a little bit of water (1 tablespoon at a time) to help it blend.

4. **Taste and Adjust:** Once blended, taste your cashew cheese. You can adjust the salt, lemon juice, or any other seasonings according to your preference.

5. **Chill:** Transfer the cashew cheese to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a lid. Let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour to allow the flavors to meld and the cheese to firm up a bit.

6. **Serve:** Enjoy your vegan cashew cheese as a spread on crackers, bread, or fresh vegetables. It can also be used as a creamy topping for salads or pasta.

**Storage Tip:** Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it for longer storage; just thaw it in the fridge when you’re ready to use it.

This vegan cashew cheese is not only delicious but also versatile, making it a great addition to various meals. Enjoy!

Query: My kid needs a nut-free cookie recipe for school but she's super picky and only likes chocolate
Dietary Restriction: nut-free
Recipe Response: Here's a delightful recipe for Chocolate Chip Cookies that are nut-free and sure to please even the pickiest of eaters! This recipe serves 2 people, making about 6-8 cookies depending on the size.

### Nut-Free Chocolate Chip Cookies

#### Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg yolk
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (make sure they are nut-free)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent sticking.

2. **Cream the Butter and Sugars**: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, add the softened butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Using an electric mixer or a wooden spoon, cream these ingredients together until the mixture is light and fluffy. This should take about 2-3 minutes.

3. **Add Egg Yolks**: Carefully separate an egg and place the yolk in the bowl (save the egg white for another use or discard it). Mix until fully incorporated.

4. **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Use a whisk to blend them well, ensuring there are no lumps.

5. **Mix Dry into Wet**: Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients. Stir until just combined; be careful not to overmix. The dough should be slightly crumbly but form into a ball easily.

6. **Fold in Chocolate Chips**: Gently fold the semi-sweet chocolate chips into the dough with a spatula until they are evenly distributed.

7. **Scoop the Dough**: Using a tablespoon or cookie scoop, portion out the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. **Bake**: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden and the centers look slightly underbaked. They will continue to cook on the baking sheet after removing them from the oven.

9. **Cool**: Allow the cookies to sit on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. **Serve**: Enjoy these cookies warm or at room temperature. They can be stored in an airtight container for a few days.

These nut-free chocolate chip cookies are not only easy to make but also utterly scrumptious! Perfect for school lunches or a sweet treat at home. Enjoy!

FAIL,"The recipe attempts to modify a traditional fruit cake to be more suitable for someone with diabetes by reducing sugar content and using sugar substitutes. However, there are several concerns that make it not fully diabetic-friendly. Firstly, the use of whole wheat flour, while healthier than refined flour, still contains carbohydrates that can affect blood sugar levels. Additionally, the inclusion of honey, even as an optional ingredient, is not ideal for a diabetic-friendly recipe due to its high glycemic index. Although the recipe suggests using a sugar substitute, the presence of dried fruits, even unsweetened, can still contribute significant natural sugars and carbohydrates. The recipe does not provide specific guidance on the portion size or the carbohydrate content per serving, which is crucial for managing blood sugar levels.

Query: I'm diabetic but I want to make a fruit cake for Christmas. My grandmother's recipe has tons of sugar and dried fruit but it's tradition and I can't just skip it this year. Is there any way to modify it so I can still participate in the family tradition without spiking my blood sugar?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Absolutely! You can create a wonderful diabetes-friendly fruit cake that honors your grandmother’s tradition while being more suitable for your dietary needs. Here’s a modified recipe that reduces sugar and incorporates wholesome ingredients.

### Diabetes-Friendly Fruit Cake Recipe

#### Serving Size: 2 people

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/4 cup honey or a sugar substitute (like stevia or erythritol) to taste
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)
- 1/2 cup mixed dried fruit (choose unsweetened options, such as raisins, dried apricots, or cranberries - check for low sugar brands)
- 1/2 cup fresh fruit (like chopped apples or pears)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease a small loaf pan or line it with parchment paper for a non-stick finish.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. This will ensure even distribution of the leavening agents and spices.

3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, combine the unsweetened applesauce, honey (or your preferred sugar substitute), and eggs. Whisk them together until well-blended and smooth. Add the vanilla extract to the mixture.

4. **Combine the Mixtures:** Carefully fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Do not overmix; just stir until there are no dry spots.

5. **Add Fruits and Nuts:** Gently fold in the mixed dried fruits, fresh chopped fruits, and nuts. Ensure that they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.

6. **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula if needed. Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

7. **Cool the Cake:** Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. **Serve:** Once cooled, slice the fruit cake into servings. This recipe is best enjoyed fresh, but you can store leftovers in an airtight container for up to a week.

### Note:
Enjoy your fruit cake in moderation as part of a balanced meal to maintain stable blood sugar levels while participating in your family tradition. The natural sweetness from the fruits combined with the spices will still give you that festive flavor!

Here’s a modified recipe that reduces sugar and incorporates wholesome ingredients.

### Diabetes-Friendly Fruit Cake Recipe

#### Serving Size: 2 people

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg (optional)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/4 cup honey or a sugar substitute (like stevia or erythritol) to taste
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)
- 1/2 cup mixed dried fruit (choose unsweetened options, such as raisins, dried apricots, or cranberries - check for low sugar brands)
- 1/2 cup fresh fruit (like chopped apples or pears)
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Begin by preheating your oven to 325°F (165°C). Grease a small loaf pan or line it with parchment paper for a non-stick finish.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. This will ensure even distribution of the leavening agents and spices.

3. **Prepare Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, combine the unsweetened applesauce, honey (or your preferred sugar substitute), and eggs. Whisk them together until well-blended and smooth. Add the vanilla extract to the mixture.

4. **Combine the Mixtures:** Carefully fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. Do not overmix; just stir until there are no dry spots.

5. **Add Fruits and Nuts:** Gently fold in the mixed dried fruits, fresh chopped fruits, and nuts. Ensure that they are evenly distributed throughout the batter.

6. **Bake:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top with a spatula if needed. Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

7. **Cool the Cake:** Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

8. **Serve:** Once cooled, slice the fruit cake into servings. This recipe is best enjoyed fresh, but you can store leftovers in an airtight container for up to a week.

Enjoy your fruit cake in moderation as part of a balanced meal to maintain stable blood sugar levels while participating in your family tradition. The natural sweetness from the fruits combined with the spices will still give you that festive flavor!

Query: Low-carb pizza recipe - I miss pizza so much
Dietary Restriction: low-carb
Recipe Response: Here’s a fantastic low-carb pizza recipe that’s not only delicious but will also satisfy your pizza cravings without the hefty carb count. This recipe uses a cauliflower crust, which is both healthy and flavorful. 

### Low-Carb Cauliflower Pizza

#### Serving Size: 2 pizzas

**Ingredients:**

For the crust:
- 1 medium head of cauliflower (about 4 cups riced cauliflower)
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (like oregano and basil)
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the toppings:
- 1/2 cup low-carb pizza sauce (or homemade marinara)
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (for topping)
- Sliced pepperoni or choice of toppings like bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms
- Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat your oven:** Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat for easy cleanup.

2. **Prepare the cauliflower:** Remove the leaves from the cauliflower and cut it into florets. Use a food processor to pulse the florets into “rice” – it should resemble gritty, damp crumbs. If you don’t have a food processor, you can also grate the cauliflower using a box grater.

3. **Cook the cauliflower:** Place the riced cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover it and microwave on high for about 8 minutes, or until tender. Once cooked, allow it to cool slightly.

4. **Squeeze out excess moisture:** Transfer the cooked cauliflower onto a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth. Gather the ends and twist to squeeze out as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial for a crisp crust. You should be left with about 1 to 1.5 cups of very dry cauliflower.

5. **Make the crust mixture:** In a large mixing bowl, combine the dried cauliflower, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese, the beaten egg, dried Italian herbs, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix until well combined.

6. **Shape the crust:** Transfer the cauliflower mixture onto the lined baking sheet. Using your hands, flatten it into a circular or rectangular shape about 1/4 inch thick. Make sure the edges are slightly thicker to create a crust.

7. **Bake the crust:** Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and crispy. Keep an eye on it to prevent burning.

8. **Add the toppings:** Once the crust is baked, carefully remove it from the oven. Spread the low-carb pizza sauce evenly over the crust and sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Add your desired toppings such as pepperoni, bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms.

9. **Final bake:** Return the pizza to the oven and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden.

10. **Serve and enjoy:** Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool slightly. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, slice, and serve.

This low-carb pizza will be a hit, and it’s an excellent way to indulge in a classic favorite without the carbs. Enjoy your delicious creation!

Recipe Response: **Recipe: Almond Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies**

*Serving Size: 2 people (makes about 6 cookies)*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil (melted) or unsalted butter (melted)
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons honey or pure maple syrup (use sparingly)
- 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (preferably 70% cocoa or higher)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent sticking and for easy cleanup.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir the mixture with a whisk or fork to ensure the ingredients are evenly blended.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   In a separate bowl, mix together the melted coconut oil (or butter), vanilla extract, egg, and honey (or maple syrup). Use a whisk to combine these until smooth.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   Slowly pour the wet ingredient mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon until everything is well combined. The dough may be slightly sticky.

5. **Add Chocolate Chips:**
   Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips into the dough, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout.

6. **Shape the Cookies:**
   Using your hands or a cookie scoop, form the dough into small balls (about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter). Place them onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each ball as they will spread slightly while baking.

7. **Flatten the Cookies:**
   Gently press down on each cookie with your fingers to flatten them slightly. This helps them bake evenly.

8. **Bake:**
   Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look soft but will firm up as they cool.

9. **Cool:**

*Serving Size: 2 people (makes about 6 cookies)*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup almond flour
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil (melted) or unsalted butter (melted)
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 large egg
- 2 tablespoons honey or pure maple syrup (use sparingly)
- 1/4 cup dark chocolate chips (preferably 70% cocoa or higher)

**Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper to prevent sticking and for easy cleanup.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
   In a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir the mixture with a whisk or fork to ensure the ingredients are evenly blended.

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:**
   In a separate bowl, mix together the melted coconut oil (or butter), vanilla extract, egg, and honey (or maple syrup). Use a whisk to combine these until smooth.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   Slowly pour the wet ingredient mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir with a spatula or wooden spoon until everything is well combined. The dough may be slightly sticky.

5. **Add Chocolate Chips:**
   Gently fold in the dark chocolate chips into the dough, ensuring they are evenly distributed throughout.

6. **Shape the Cookies:**
   Using your hands or a cookie scoop, form the dough into small balls (about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter). Place them onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving some space between each ball as they will spread slightly while baking.

7. **Flatten the Cookies:**
   Gently press down on each cookie with your fingers to flatten them slightly. This helps them bake evenly.

8. **Bake:**
   Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look soft but will firm up as they cool.

9. **Cool:**
   After baking, remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

10. **Serve:**
    Enjoy your warm, gooey almond flour chocolate chip cookies with a cup of herbal tea or simply as a delightful treat on their own!

FAIL,"The recipe attempts to modify a traditional fruit cake to be more diabetic-friendly by using natural sweeteners like erythritol or monk fruit sweetener instead of sugar, and unsweetened dried fruits.

Query: I'm diabetic but I want to make a fruit cake for Christmas. My grandmother's recipe has tons of sugar and dried fruit but it's tradition and I can't just skip it this year. Is there any way to modify it so I can still participate in the family tradition without spiking my blood sugar?
Dietary Restriction: diabetic-friendly
Recipe Response: Absolutely! You can create a delicious diabetic-friendly fruit cake that still pays homage to your grandmother's tradition. This recipe uses natural sweeteners and incorporates nuts, which provide healthy fats and protein. Here’s how to make a diabetic-friendly fruit cake that serves 2 people.

### Diabetic-Friendly Fruit Cake Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
- 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any low-carb, unsweetened milk)
- 1/2 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or almonds)
- 1/2 cup mixed dried fruits (sugar-free variety like unsweetened raisins, cranberries, or apricots, cut into small pieces)
- 1/4 cup erythritol or monk fruit sweetener (similar sweetness to sugar)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Optional: Zest of 1 orange or lemon (for added flavor)

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a small loaf pan or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, erythritol (or preferred sweetener), baking powder, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and salt until well combined.

3. **Add Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, combine the unsweetened applesauce, unsweetened almond milk, vanilla extract, and citrus zest if using. Mix well until everything is evenly blended.

4. **Combine Mixtures:** Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir gently until just combined. Be careful not to overmix – a few lumps are perfectly fine.

5. **Fold in Fruits and Nuts:** Gently fold in the chopped nuts and your choice of chopped dried fruits. This will add texture and flavor to your cake.

6. **Transfer to Pan:** Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, smoothing the top with a spatula.

7. **Bake:** Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 35-40 minutes. Check doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center; it should come out clean or with just a few crumbs.

8. **Cool:** Once baked, remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.

9. **Serve:** Slice the cake once it’s completely cool. You can enjoy it plain, or serve it with a dollop of unsweetened Greek yogurt on top for added creaminess.

### Enjoy:
This diabetic-friendly fruit cake is a great way to maintain your family's traditions while being mindful of your health. The flavors of the spices and the crunchy nuts combined with the sweetness from the dried fruits will surely evoke the holiday spirit!

### Coconut Chickpea Curry

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup canned chickpeas (drained and rinsed)

- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh cilantro (for garnish, optional)
- Cooked rice (for serving)

#### Instructions:

1. **Heat the Oil**: In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, add the vegetable oil. Once hot, add the grated fresh ginger and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.

2. **Add the Vegetables**: Stir in the diced bell pepper and sliced carrot. Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften.

3. **Spice It Up**: Sprinkle the curry powder, ground cumin, and turmeric over the vegetables. Mix well, allowing the spices to toast slightly for about 1 minute, which will help enhance their flavors.

5. **Incorporate Chickpeas and Coconut Milk**: Add in the drained chickpeas and the can of coconut milk. Stir everything together well, ensuring the chickpeas are coated in the coconut curry sauce.

6. **Simmer the Curry**: Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer uncovered for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the curry to thicken slightly. Stir occasionally. If you prefer a thinner sauce, you can add a splash of water to reach your desired consistency.

7. **Season to Taste**: After simmering, taste the curry and add salt and pepper according to your preference.

8. **Serve**: Once the curry is ready, spoon it into bowls over a bed of warm cooked rice.

### Coconut Chickpea Curry

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup canned chickpeas (drained and rinsed)
- 1 can (14 oz) coconut milk
- 1 medium tomato (chopped)
- 1 small bell pepper (diced, any color you prefer)
- 1 medium carrot (sliced)
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger (grated)
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh cilantro (for garnish, optional)
- Cooked rice (for serving)

#### Instructions:

1. **Heat the Oil**: In a medium-sized pot over medium heat, add the vegetable oil. Once hot, add the grated fresh ginger and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant.

2. **Add the Vegetables**: Stir in the diced bell pepper and sliced carrot. Cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften.

3. **Spice It Up**: Sprinkle the curry powder, ground cumin, and turmeric over the vegetables. Mix well, allowing the spices to toast slightly for about 1 minute, which will help enhance their flavors.

4. **Add the Tomato**: Incorporate the chopped tomato into the pot, stirring to combine everything. Let it cook for another 2-3 minutes until the tomatoes soften a little.

5. **Incorporate Chickpeas and Coconut Milk**: Add in the drained chickpeas and the can of coconut milk. Stir everything together well, ensuring the chickpeas are coated in the coconut curry sauce.

6. **Simmer the Curry**: Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer uncovered for about 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the curry to thicken slightly. Stir occasionally. If you prefer a thinner sauce, you can add a splash of water to reach your desired consistency.

7. **Season to Taste**: After simmering, taste the curry and add salt and pepper according to your preference.

8. **Serve**: Once the curry is ready, spoon it into bowls over a bed of warm cooked rice. 

9. **Garnish (Optional)**: If you'd like, garnish with fresh cilantro for a burst of color and flavor.

Query: Vegan protein smoothie that doesn't taste chalky
Dietary Restriction: vegan
Recipe Response: Here’s a delicious and creamy Vegan Protein Smoothie recipe that is both nutritious and smooth, without that chalky texture often associated with protein powders!

### Creamy Vegan Protein Smoothie

**Servings:** 2

#### Ingredients:
- 1 ripe banana
- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any plant-based milk of your choice)
- 2 tablespoons natural almond butter (or peanut butter)
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds (great for added fiber and healthy fats)
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup (adjust based on your sweetness preference)
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- A handful of fresh spinach (optional, for added nutrients)
- Ice cubes (optional, for a colder smoothie)
  
#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare Ingredients:** Start by peeling the ripe banana and breaking it into smaller chunks. This will help with blending. If you are using fresh spinach, you can wash and dry it.

2. **Blend the Base:** In a blender, combine the banana, almond milk, almond butter, chia seeds, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. If you’d like a colder smoothie, add a few ice cubes as well.

3. **Optional Add-ins:** If you're using spinach, add it to the blender at this stage. The banana's flavor will mask the taste of the spinach, and it also won’t affect the texture noticeably.

4. **Blend Smooth:** Start blending on low speed to break everything down, then gradually increase to high speed. Blend for about 30 seconds to 1 minute until the smoothie is completely smooth and creamy. If it seems too thick, add a bit more almond milk until you reach your desired consistency.

5. **Taste and Adjust:** Once blended, taste your smoothie. If you prefer it sweeter, add more maple syrup and blend again briefly.

6. **Serve:** Pour the smoothie into two glasses. Optionally, you can sprinkle a few additional chia seeds on top for garnish or some extra almond butter.

7. **Enjoy:** Grab a straw or simply drink it straight from the glass. This creamy vegan protein smoothie is not only satisfying but also packed with wholesome nutrition.

This recipe is a great way to start your day or replenish your energy after a workout. Enjoy your smoothie!
